Granger Causality: Basic Theory and Application to Neuroscience, Multi-electrode neurophysiological recordings produce massive quantities of data. Multivariate time series analysis provides the basic framework for analyzing the patterns of neural interactions in these data. It has long been recognized that neural interactions are directional. Being able to assess the directionality of neuronal interactions is thus a highly desired capability for understanding the cooperative nature of neural computation. Research over the last few years has shown that Granger causality is a key technique to furnish this capability. The main goal of this article is to provide an expository introduction to the concept of Granger causality. Mathematical frameworks for both bivariate Granger causality and conditional Granger causality are developed in detail with particular emphasis on their spectral representations. The technique is demonstrated in numerical examples where the exact answers of causal influences are known. It is then applied to analyze multichannel local field potentials recorded from monkeys performing a visuomotor task. Our results are shown to be physiologically interpretable and yield new insights into the dynamical organization of large-scale oscillatory cortical networks."

Specifying Distributed Software Architectures, Abstract. There is a real need for clear and sound design speci cations of distributed systems at the architectural level. This is the level of the design which deals with the high-level organisation of computational elements and the interactions between those elements. The paper presents the Darwin notation for specifying this high-level organisation. Darwin is in essence a declarative binding language which can be used to de ne hierarchic compositions of interconnected components. Distribution is dealt with orthogonally to system structuring. The language supports the speci cation of both static structures and dynamic structures which mayevolve during execution. The central abstractions managed by Darwin are components and services. Services are the means by which components interact. In addition to its use in specifying the architecture of a distributed system

Probabilistic Non-linear Principal Component Analysis with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models, Summarising a high dimensional data set with a low dimensional embedding is a standard approach for exploring its structure. In this paper we provide an overview of some existing techniques for discovering such embeddings. We then introduce a novel probabilistic interpretation of principal component analysis (PCA) that we term dual probabilistic PCA (DPPCA). The DPPCA model has the additional advantage that the linear mappings from the embedded space can easily be non- linearised through Gaussian processes. We refer to this model as a Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM). Through analysis of the GP-LVM objective function

Iterative approach to model identification of biological networks, BACKGROUND: Recent advances in molecular biology techniques provide an opportunity for developing detailed mathematical models of biological processes. An iterative scheme is introduced for model identification using available system knowledge and experimental measurements. RESULTS: The scheme includes a state regulator algorithm that provides estimates of all system unknowns (concentrations of the system components and the reaction rates of their inter-conversion). The full system information is used for estimation of the model parameters. An optimal experiment design using the parameter identifiability and D-optimality criteria is formulated to provide ""rich"" experimental data for maximizing the accuracy of the parameter estimates in subsequent iterations. The importance of model identifiability tests for optimal measurement selection is also considered. The iterative scheme is tested on a model for the caspase function in apoptosis where it is demonstrated that model accuracy improves with each iteration. Optimal experiment design was determined to be critical for model identification. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm has general application to modeling a wide range of cellular processes

Optical Clocks and Relativity, Observers in relative motion or at different gravitational potentials measure disparate clock rates. These predictions of relativity have previously been observed with atomic clocks at high velocities and with large changes in elevation. We observed time dilation from relative speeds of less than 10 meters per second by comparing two optical atomic clocks connected by a 75-meter length of optical fiber. We can now also detect time dilation due to a change in height near Earth's surface of less than 1 meter. This technique may be extended to the field of geodesy

These same reward-related brain areas also mediate preferences that are social in nature even when no direct reward is expected. The second network focuses on regions active when a person must make estimates of another person's intentions. However
Internet Paradox Revisited, Kraut et al. (1998) reported small but reliable negative effects of using the Internet on measures of social involvement and psychological well-being among Pittsburgh families in 1995-1996.

The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses
Causal reasoning in rats., Empirical research with nonhuman primates appears to support the view that causal reasoning is a key cognitive faculty that divides humans from animals. The claim is that animals approximate causal learning using associative processes. The present results cast doubt on that conclusion. Rats made causal inferences in a basic task that taps into core features of causal reasoning without requiring complex physical knowledge. They derived predictions of the outcomes of interventions after passive observational learning of different kinds of causal models. These competencies cannot be explained by current associative theories but are consistent with causal Bayes net theories."

Assembly of protein tertiary structures from fragments with similar local sequences using simulated annealing and Bayesian scoring functions., We explore the ability of a simple simulated annealing procedure to assemble native-like structures from fragments of unrelated protein structures with similar local sequences using Bayesian scoring functions. Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns

LinkHub: a Semantic Web system that facilitates cross-database queries and information retrieval in proteomics., BACKGROUND: A key abstraction in representing proteomics knowledge is the notion of unique identifiers for individual entities (e.g. proteins) and the massive graph of relationships among them. These relationships are sometimes simple (e.g. synonyms) but are often more complex (e.g. one-to-many relationships in protein family membership). RESULTS: We have built a software system called LinkHub using Semantic Web RDF that manages the graph of identifier relationships and allows exploration with a variety of interfaces. For efficiency

Existing reserve systems throughout the world contain a biased sample of biodiversity

Frequent Gain and Loss of Functional Transcription Factor Binding Sites, Cis-regulatory sequences are not always conserved across species. Divergence within cis-regulatory sequences may result from the evolution of species-specific patterns of gene expression or the flexible nature of the cis-regulatory code. The identification of functional divergence in cis-regulatory sequences is therefore important for both understanding the role of gene regulation in evolution and annotating regulatory elements. We have developed an evolutionary model to detect the loss of constraint on individual transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We find that a significant fraction of functionally constrained binding sites have been lost in a lineage-specific manner among three closely related yeast species. Binding site loss has previously been explained by turnover

Automated text processing can aid in the comprehension and synthesis of this valuable information. The fundamental task of identifying gene and protein names is a necessary first step towards making full use of the information encoded in biomedical text. This remains a challenging task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in gene and protein nomenclature. We propose to approach the detection of gene and protein names in scientific abstracts as part-of-speech tagging

The development of Enhanced SemRep is based on the adaptation of an existing system and crucially depends on domain knowledge in the Unified Medical Language System. We provide a preliminary evaluation (55\\ recall and 73% precision) and discuss the potential of this system in assisting both clinical practice and scientific investigation."

A New Look At The Path Integral Of Quantum Mechanics, The Feynman path integral of ordinary quantum mechanics is complexified and it is shown that possible integration cycles for this complexified integral are associated with branes in a two-dimensional A-model. This provides a fairly direct explanation of the relationship of the A-model to quantum mechanics; such a relationship has been explored from several points of view in the last few years. These phenomena have an analog for Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions: integration cycles in the path integral of this theory can be derived from N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Hence

Wizard of Oz prototyping of computer vision based action games for children, This paper describes the use of the Wizard of Oz (WOz) method in the design of computer vision based action games controlled with body movements. A WOz study was carried out with 34 children of ages 7 to 9 in order to find out the most intuitive movements for game controls and to evaluate the relationship between avatar and player actions. Our study extends the previous Wizard of Oz studies by showing that WOz prototyping of perceptive action games is feasible despite the delay caused by the wizard. The results also show that distinctive movement categories and gesture patterns can be found by observing the children playing games controlled by a human wizard. The approach minimizes the need for fully functional prototypes in the early stages of the design and provides video material for testing and developing computer vision algorithms

CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants: 1998, This paper gives the 2002 self-consistent set of values of the basic constants and conversion factors of physics and chemistry recommended by the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) for international use. Further; it describes in detail the adjustment of the values of the subset of constants on which the complete 2002 set of recommended values is based. Two noteworthy additions in the 2002 adjustment are recommended values for the bound-state rms charge radii of the proton and deuteron and tests of the exactness of the Josephson and quantum-Hall-effect relations K J =2 e 鈭?h and R K = h 鈭?e 2 ; where K J and R K are the Josephson and von Klitzing constants; respectively; e is the elementary charge; and h is the Planck constant. The 2002 set replaces the previously recommended 1998 CODATA set. The 2002 adjustment takes into account the data considered in the 1998 adjustment as well as the data that became available between 31 December 1998; the closing date of that adjustment; and 31 December 2002; the closing date of the new adjustment. The differences between the 2002 and 1998 recommended values compared to the uncertainties of the latter are generally not unreasonable. The new CODATA set of recommended values may also be found on the World Wide Web at physics.nist.gov/constants."

A Predictive Model for Transcriptional Control of Physiology in a Free Living Cell,  SummaryThe environment significantly influences the dynamic expression and assembly of all components encoded in the genome of an organism into functional biological networks. We have constructed a model for this process in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 through the data-driven discovery of regulatory and functional interrelationships among 80% of its genes and key abiotic factors in its hypersaline environment. Using relative changes in 72 transcription factors and 9 environmental factors (EFs) this model accurately predicts dynamic transcriptional responses of all these genes in 147 newly collected experiments representing completely novel genetic backgrounds and environments鈥攕uggesting a remarkable degree of network completeness. Using this model we have constructed and tested hypotheses critical to this organism's interaction with its changing hypersaline environment. This study supports the claim that the high degree of connectivity within biological and EF networks will enable the construction of similar models for any organism from relatively modest numbers of experiments. IntroductionRapid DNA sequencing technology has provided access to a large number of complete genome sequences from diverse and often poorly characterized organisms. The hope is to use this information for engineering new biotechnological solutions to diverse problems spanning bioenergy

CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature, This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature - an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms

Novelty and redundancy detection in adaptive filtering, This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents.

The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents."

Toward Distributed Service Discovery in Pervasive Computing Environments, The paper proposes a novel distributed service discovery protocol for pervasive environments. The protocol is based on the concepts of peer-to-peer caching of service advertisements and group-based intelligent forwarding of service requests. It does not require a service to be registered with a registry or lookup server. Services are described using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We exploit the semantic class/subClass hierarchy of OWL to describe service groups and use this semantic information to selectively forward service requests. OWL-based service description also enables increased flexibility in service matching. We present simulation results that show that our protocol achieves increased efficiency in discovering services (compared to traditional broadcast-based mechanisms) by efficiently utilizing bandwidth via controlled forwarding of service requests."

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a  function f which is positive on S and negative on the complement. The  functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially  small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of  the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients  are found by solving a quadratic programming problem

An overview of statistical learning theory, Statistical learning theory was introduced in the late 1960's. Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems"

Chaos in neuronal networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory activity, Neurons in the cortex of behaving animals show temporally irregular spiking patterns. The origin of this irregularity and its implications for neural processing are unknown. The hypothesis that the temporal variability in the firing of a neuron results from an approximate balance between its excitatory and inhibitory inputs was investigated theoretically. Such a balance emerges naturally in large networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations that are sparsely connected by relatively strong synapses. The resulting state is characterized by strongly chaotic dynamics

Stemming algorithms: A case study for detailed evaluation, The majority of information retrieval experiments are evaluated by measures such as average precision and average recall. Fundamental decisions about the superiority of one retrieval technique over another are made solely on the basis of these measures.

This article is a case study of stemming algorithms which describes a number of novel approaches to evaluation and demonstrates their value. &copy; 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons

Quantum Mechanics helps in searching for a needle in a haystack, Quantum mechanics can speed up a range of search applications over unsorted data. For example; imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order. To find someone's phone number with a probability of 50%; any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to access the database a minimum of 0.5 N times. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations; successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result; the desired phone number can be obtained in only O ( sqrt [ N ] ) accesses to the database."

Designing Run-Time Fault-Tolerance Using Dynamic Updates, We present a framework for designing run-time faulttolerance using dynamic program updates triggered by faults. This is an important problem in the design of autonomous systems as it is often the case that a running program needs to be upgraded to its fault-tolerant version once faults occur. We formally state fault-triggered program updates as a design problem. We then present a sound and complete algorithm that automates the design of faulttriggered updates for replacing a program that does not tolerate faults with a fault-tolerant version thereof at run-time. We also define three classes of fault-triggered dynamic updates that tolerate faults during the update. We demonstrate our approach in the context of a fault-triggered update for the gate controller of a parking lot."

Contradicted and initially stronger effects in highly cited clinical research., Context  Controversy and uncertainty ensue when the results of clinical research on the effectiveness of interventions are subsequently contradicted. Controversies are most prominent when high-impact research is involved.  Objectives  To understand how frequently highly cited studies are contradicted or find effects that are stronger than in other similar studies and to discern whether specific characteristics are associated with such refutation over time.  Design  All original clinical research studies published in 3 major general clinical journals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in 1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were examined.  Main Outcome Measure  The results of highly cited articles were compared against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and similar or better controlled designs. The same analysis was also performed comparatively for matched studies that were not so highly cited.  Results  Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies

PseudoPipe: an automated pseudogene identification pipeline, Motivation: Mammalian genomes contain many  genomic fossils' i.e. pseudogenes. These are disabled copies of functional genes that have been retained in the genome by gene duplication or retrotransposition events. Pseudogenes are important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes.  Results: We have developed a homology-based computational pipeline ( PseudoPipe') that can search a mammalian genome and identify pseudogene sequences in a comprehensive and consistent manner. The key steps in the pipeline involve using BLAST to rapidly cross-reference potential ""parent"" proteins against the intergenic regions of the genome and then processing the resulting ""raw hits"" -- i.e. eliminating redundant ones

The Empirical Case for Two Systems of Reasoning, <div>Distinctions have been proposed between systems of reasoning for centuries. This article distills properties shared by many of these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system is associative because its computations reflect similarity structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is ""rule based"" because it operates on symbolic structures that have logical content and variables and because its computations have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of the distinction and its characterization.</div>"

Authentication in Distributed Systems: Theory and Practice, We describe a theory of authentication and a system that implements it. Our theory is based on the notion of principal and a &ldquo;speaks for&rdquo; relation between principals. A simple principal either has a name or is a communication channel; a compound principal can express an adopted role or delegated authority. The theory shows how to reason about a principal's authority by deducing the other principals that it can speak for; authenticating a channel is one important application. We use the theory to explain many existing and proposed security mechanisms. In particular

Finding function: evaluation methods for functional genomic data, BACKGROUND: Accurate evaluation of the quality of genomic or proteomic data and computational methods is vital to our ability to use them for formulating novel biological hypotheses and directing further experiments. There is currently no standard approach to evaluation in functional genomics. Our analysis of existing approaches shows that they are inconsistent and contain substantial functional biases that render the resulting evaluations misleading both quantitatively and qualitatively. These problems make it essentially impossible to compare computational methods or large-scale experimental datasets and also result in conclusions that generalize poorly in most biological applications. RESULTS: We reveal issues with current evaluation methods here and suggest new approaches to evaluation that facilitate accurate and representative characterization of genomic methods and data. Specifically

A robust statistical method for case-control association testing with copy number variation., Copy number variation (CNV) is pervasive in the human genome and can play a causal role in genetic diseases. The functional impact of CNV cannot be fully captured through linkage disequilibrium with SNPs. These observations motivate the development of statistical methods for performing direct CNV association studies. We show through simulation that current tests for CNV association are prone to false-positive associations in the presence of differential errors between cases and controls

Inference of Bacterial Microevolution Using Multilocus Sequence Data, We describe a model-based method for using multilocus sequence data to infer the clonal relationships of bacteria and the chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that disrupt a clonal pattern of inheritance. The key assumption of our model is that recombination events introduce a constant rate of substitutions to a contiguous region of sequence. The method is applicable both to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data from a few loci and to alignments of multiple bacterial genomes. It can be used to decide whether a subset of isolates share common ancestry

Debunking the 100X GPU vs. CPU myth: an evaluation of throughput computing on CPU and GPU, Recent advances in computing have led to an explosion in the amount of data being generated. Processing the ever-growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important aspect for emerging applications. Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for today's multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups (between 10X and 1000X) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from
Scaling and power-laws in ecological systems., Scaling relationships (where body size features as the independent variable) and power-law distributions are commonly reported in ecological systems. In this review we analyze scaling relationships related to energy acquisition and transformation and power-laws related to fluctuations in numbers. Our aim is to show how individual level attributes can help to explain and predict patterns at the level of populations that can propagate at upper levels of organization. We review similar relationships also appearing in the analysis of aquatic ecosystems (i.e. the biomass spectra) in the context of ecological invariant relationships (i.e. independent of size) such as the 鈥榚nergetic equivalence rule鈥?and the 鈥榣inear biomass hypothesis鈥? We also discuss some power-law distributions emerging in the analysis of numbers and fluctuations in ecological attributes as they point to regularities that are yet to be integrated with traditional scaling relationships and which we foresee as an exciting area of future research."

Epidemic threshold in structured scale-free networks, We analyze the spreading of viruses in scale-free networks with high clustering and degree correlations; as found in the Internet graph. For the susceptible-infected-susceptible model of epidemics the prevalence undergoes a phase transition at a finite threshold of the transmission probability. Comparing with the absence of a finite threshold in networks with purely random wiring; our result suggests that high clustering ( modularity ) and degree correlations protect scale-free networks against the spreading of viruses. We introduce and verify a quantitative description of the epidemic threshold based on the connectivity of the neighborhoods of the hubs."

GeneMarkS: a self-training method for prediction of gene starts in microbial genomes. Implications for finding sequence motifs in regulatory regions, Improving the accuracy of prediction of gene starts is one of a few remaining open problems in computer prediction of prokaryotic genes. Its difficulty is caused by the absence of relatively strong sequence patterns identifying true translation initiation sites. In the current paper we show that the accuracy of gene start prediction can be improved by combining models of protein-coding and non-coding regions and models of regulatory sites near gene start within an iterative Hidden Markov model based algorithm. The new gene prediction method

Resting fluctuations in arterial carbon dioxide induce significant low frequency variations in BOLD signal., Carbon dioxide is a potent cerebral vasodilator. We have identified a significant source of low-frequency variation in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal at 3 T arising from spontaneous fluctuations in arterial carbon dioxide level in volunteers at rest. Fluctuations in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pet(CO(2))) of +/-1.1 mm Hg in the frequency range 0-0.05 Hz were observed in a cohort of nine volunteers. Correlating with these fluctuations were significant generalized grey and white matter BOLD signal fluctuations. We observed a mean (+/-standard error) regression coefficient across the group of 0.110 +/- 0.033\% BOLD signal change per mm Hg CO(2) for grey matter and 0.049 +/- 0.022\% per mm Hg in white matter. Pet(CO(2))-related BOLD signal fluctuations showed regional differences across the grey matter

Support-vector networks, The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."
