An analysis of the most cited articles in software engineering journals--1999, Citations and related work are crucial in any research to position the work and to build on the work of others. A high citation count is an indication of the influence of specific articles. The importance of citations means that it is interesting to analyze which articles are cited the most. Such an analysis has been conducted using the ISI Web of Science to identify the most cited software engineering journal articles published in 2000. The objective of the analysis is to identify and list the articles that have influenced others the most as measured by citation count. An understanding of which research is viewed by the research community as most valuable to build upon may provide valuable insights into what research to focus on now and in the future.

Disordered Electronic Systems, This paper reviews the progress made in the last several years in understanding the properties of disordered electronic systems. Even in the metallic limit; serious deviations from the Boltzmann transport theory and Fermi-liquid theory have been predicted and observed experimentally. There are two important ingredients in this new understanding: the concept of Anderson localization and the effects of interaction between electrons in a disordered medium. This paper emphasizes the theoretical aspect; even though some of the relevant experiments are also examined. The bulk of the paper focuses on the metallic side; but the authors also discuss the metal-to-insulator transition and comment on problems associated with the insulator."

Direct Optimization of Ranking Measures, Web page ranking and collaborative filtering require the optimization of sophisticated performance measures. Current Support Vector approaches are unable to optimize them directly and focus on pairwise comparisons instead. We present a new approach which allows direct optimization of the relevant loss functions. This is achieved via structured estimation in Hilbert spaces. It is most related to Max-Margin-Markov networks optimization of multivariate performance measures. Key to our approach is that during training the ranking problem can be viewed as a linear assignment problem

Reference scenarios for deforestation and forest degradation in support of REDD: a review of data and methods, Global climate policy initiatives are now being proposed to compensate tropical forest nations for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). These proposals have the potential to include developing countries more actively in international greenhouse gas mitigation and to address a substantial share of the world's emissions which come from tropical deforestation. For such a policy to be viable it must have a credible benchmark against which emissions reduction can be calculated. This benchmark

Computing Geodesics and Minimal Surfaces via Graph Cuts, Geodesic active contours and graph cuts are two standard image segmentation techniques. We introduce a new segmentation method combining some of their benefits. Our main intuition is that any cut on a graph embedded in some continuous space can be interpreted as a contour (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D). We show how to build a grid graph and set its edge weights so that the cost of cuts is arbitrarily close to the length (area) of the corresponding contours (surfaces) for any anisotropic Riemannian metric. There are two interesting consequences of this technical result. First

How Meaning Shapes Seeing, {ABSTRACT-} Inattentional blindness refers to the failure to see an unexpected object that one may be looking at directly when one's attention is elsewhere. We studied whether a stimulus whose meaning is relevant to the attentional goals of the observer will capture attention and escape inattentional blindness. The results showed that an unexpected stimulus belonging to the attended semantic category but not sharing physical features with the attended stimuli was detected more often than a semantically unrelated stimulus. This e铿€ect was larger when the unexpected stimuli were words than when they were pictures. The results imply that the semantic relation between the observer's attentional set and the unexpected stimulus plays a crucial role in inattentional blindness: An unexpected stimulus semantically related to the observer's current interests is likely to be seen

What is a population? An empirical evaluation of some genetic methods for identifying the number of gene pools and their degree of connectivity, We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered 'populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model.

Knowledge Networks: Explaining Effective Knowledge Sharing in Multiunit Companies, This paper introduces the concept of knowledge networks to explain why some business units are able to benefit from knowledge residing in other parts of the company while others are not. The core premise of this concept is that a proper understanding of effective interunit knowledge sharing in a multiunit firm requires a joint consideration of relatedness in knowledge content among business units and the network of lateral interunit relations that enables task units to access related knowledge. Results from a study of 120 new product development projects in 41 business units of a large multiunit electronics company showed that project teams obtained more existing knowledge from other units and completed their projects faster to the extent that they had short interunit network paths to units that possessed related knowledge. In contrast

RAxML-III: a fast program for maximum likelihood-based inference of large phylogenetic trees., Motivation: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with statistical models such as maximum likelihood or bayesian inference is computationally extremely intensive. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and computational complexity the size of trees which can be computed on a Biologist's PC workstation within reasonable time is limited to trees containing approximately 100 taxa.               Results: In this paper we present the latest release of our program RAxML-III for rapid maximum likelihood-based inference of large evolutionary trees which allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours on a single PC processor. We compare RAxML-III to the currently fastest implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian inference: PHYML and MrBayes. Whereas RAxML-III performs worse than PHYML and MrBayes on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values.               Availability Supplementary information: RAxML-III including all alignments and final trees mentioned in this paper is freely available as open source code at http://wwwbode.cs.tum/~stamatak                           Contact:                stamatak@cs.tum.edu"

Normalization of cDNA microarray data, Normalization means to adjust microarray data for effects which arise from variation in the technology rather than from biological differences between the RNA samples or between the printed probes. This paper describes normalization methods based on the fact that dye balance typically varies with spot intensity and with spatial position on the array. Print-tip loess normalization provides a well-tested general purpose normalization method which has given good results on a wide range of arrays. The method may be refined by using quality weights for individual spots. The method is best combined with diagnostic plots of the data which display the spatial and intensity trends. When diagnostic plots show that biases still remain in the data after normalization

Indexing based on scale invariant interest points, This paper presents a new method for detecting scale invariant interest points. The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale
Self-organization of orientation sensitive cells in the striate cortex, A nerve net model for the visual cortex of higher vertebrates is presented. A simple learning procedure is shown to be sufficient for the organization of some essential functional properties of single units. The rather special assumptions usually made in the literature regarding preorganization of the visual cortex are thereby avoided. The model consists of 338 neurones forming a sheet analogous to the cortex. The neurones are connected randomly to a 鈥渞etina鈥?of 19 cells. Nine different stimuli in the form of light bars were applied. The afferent connections were modified according to a mechanism of synaptic training. After twenty presentations of all the stimuli individual cortical neurones became sensitive to only one orientation. Neurones with the same or similar orientation sensitivity tended to appear in clusters

Detecting fuzzy community structures in complex networks with a Potts  model, A fast community detection algorithm based on a q-state Potts model is presented. Communities in networks (groups of densely interconnected nodes that are only loosely connected to the rest of the network) are found to coincide with the domains of equal spin value in the minima of a modified Potts spin glass Hamiltonian. Comparing global and local minima of the Hamiltonian allows for the detection of overlapping (``fuzzy'') communities and quantifying the association of nodes to multiple communities as well as the robustness of a community. No prior knowledge of the number of communities has to be assumed."

Viral population estimation using pyrosequencing, The diversity of virus populations within single infected hosts presents a major difficulty for the natural immune response as well as for vaccine design and antiviral drug therapy.

We present computational methods for the analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing data obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of the sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a statistical approach to error correction

We therefore present here a database of Drosophila CRMs curated from the literature complete with both DNA sequence and a searchable description of the gene expression pattern regulated by each CRM. This resource should greatly facilitate the development of computational approaches to CRM discovery as well as bioinformatics analyses of regulatory sequence properties and evolution.Availability:http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.eduContact:mshalfon@buffalo.edu"

An improved map of conserved regulatory sites for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BACKGROUND: The regulatory map of a genome consists of the binding sites for proteins that determine the transcription of nearby genes. An initial regulatory map for S. cerevisiae was recently published using six motif discovery programs to analyze genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data for 203 transcription factors. The programs were used to identify sequence motifs that were likely to correspond to the DNA-binding specificity of the immunoprecipitated proteins. We report improved versions of two conservation-based motif discovery algorithms

Defining clusters from a hierarchical cluster tree: the Dynamic Tree Cut package for R, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm563 Summary: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method

Survey propagation: an algorithm for satisfiability, We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas formed by $M$ clauses of exactly $K$ literals over $N$ Boolean variables. For a given value of $N$ the problem is known to be most difficult with $\alpha=M/N$ close to the experimental threshold $\alpha_c$ separating the region where almost all formulas are SAT from the region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to the existence of a clustering phenomenon of the solutions when $\alpha$ is close to (but smaller than) $\alpha_c$. We introduce a new type of message passing algorithm which allows to find efficiently a satisfiable assignment of the variables in the difficult region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of two main parts. The first is a message-passing procedure which generalizes the usual methods like Sum-Product or Belief Propagation: it passes messages that are surveys over clusters of the ordinary messages. The second part uses the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the surveys in order to fix variables and simplify the problem. Eventually

A geometric approach to macromolecule-ligand interactions., We describe a method to explore geometrically feasible alignments of ligands and receptors of known structure. Algorithms are presented that examine many binding geometries and evaluate them in terms of steric overlap. The procedure uses specific molecular conformations. A method is included for finding putative binding sites on a macromolecular surface. Results are reported for two systems: the heme-myoglobin interaction and the binding of thyroid hormone analogs to prealbumin. In each case the program finds structures within 1 脜 of the X-ray results and also finds distinctly different geometries that provide good steric fits. The approach seems well-suited for generating starting conformations for energy refinement programs and interactive computer graphics routines."

Browsing is a Collaborative Process, Interfaces to databases have traditionally been designed as single-user systems that hide other users and their activity. This paper aims to show that collaboration is an important aspect of searching online information stores that requires explicit computerised support. The claim is made that a truly user-centred system must acknowledge and support collaborative interactions between users. Collaborative working implies a need to share information: both the search product and the search process. Searches need not be restricted to inanimate resources but people can also search for other people. The ARIADNE system is introduced as an example of computerised support for collaboration between browsers. A number of systems offering varied approaches to supporting collaboration are surveyed and a structure for analysing the various aspects of collaboration is applied. ... support for communication and collaboration is as important as support for informationseeking activities

Social Components of Fitness in Primate Groups, There is much interest in the evolutionary forces that favored the evolution of large brains in the primate order. The social brain hypothesis posits that selection has favored larger brains and more complex cognitive capacities as a means to cope with the challenges of social life. The hypothesis is supported by evidence that shows that group size is linked to various measures of brain size. But it has not been clear how cognitive complexity confers fitness advantages on individuals. Research in the field and laboratory shows that sophisticated social cognition underlies social behavior in primate groups. Moreover

A Theory of Rational Addiction, We develop a theory of rational addiction in which rationality means a consistent plan to maximize utility over time.  Strong addiction to a good requires a big effect of past consumption of the good on current consumption.  Such powerful complementarities cause some steady states to be unstable.  They are an important part of our analysis because even small deviations from the consumption at an unstable steady state can lead to large cumulative rises over time in addictive consumption or to rapid falls in consumption to abstention.  Our theory also implies that ""cold turkey"" is used to end strong addictions

Finite topology as applied to image analysis, The notion of a cellular complex which is well known in the topology is applied to describe the structure of images. It is shown that the topology of cellular complexes is the only possible topology of finite sets. Under this topology no contradictions or paradoxes arise when defining connected subsets and their boundaries. Ways of encoding images as cellular complexes are discussed. The process of image segmentation is considered as splitting (in the topological sense) a cellular complex into blocks of cells. The notion of a cell list is introduced as a precise and compact data structure for encoding segmented images. Some applications of this data structure to the image analysis are demonstrated."

Pseudogene-derived small interfering RNAs regulate gene expression in mouse oocytes., Pseudogenes populate the mammalian genome as remnants of artefactual incorporation of coding messenger RNAs into transposon pathways1. Here we show that a subset of pseudogenes generates endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) in mouse oocytes. These endo-siRNAs are often processed from double-stranded RNAs formed by hybridization of spliced transcripts from protein-coding genes to antisense transcripts from homologous pseudogenes. An inverted repeat pseudogene can also generate abundant small RNAs directly. A second class of endo-siRNAs may enforce repression of mobile genetic elements

Efficient Filtering of XML Documents for Selective Dissemination of Information, Information Dissemination applications are gaining increasing popularity due to dramatic improvements in communications bandwidth and ubiquity. The sheer volume of data available necessitates the use of selective approaches to dissemination in order to avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary information. Existing mechanisms for selective dissemination typically rely on simple keyword matching or 鈥渂ag of words鈥?information retrieval techniques. The advent of XML as a standard for information exchange and the development of query languages for XML data enables the development of more sophisticated filtering mechanisms that take structure information into account. We have developed several index organizations and search algorithms for performing efficient filtering of XML documents for large-scale information dissemination systems. In this paper we describe these techniques and examine their performance across a range of document

Conditional Random Fields for Object Recognition, We present a discriminative part-based approach for the recognition of object classes from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches

The Effects of Artificial Selection on the Maize Genome, Domestication promotes rapid phenotypic evolution through artificial selection. We investigated the genetic history by which the wild grass teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) was domesticated into modern maize (Z. mays ssp. mays). Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 774 genes indicates that 2 to 4% of these genes experienced artificial selection. The remaining genes retain evidence of a population bottleneck associated with domestication. Candidate selected genes with putative function in plant growth are clustered near quantitative trait loci that contribute to phenotypic differences between maize and teosinte. If we assume that our sample of genes is representative

The first experiments have concentrated on the annotation of gene/protein names and those of organisms
Robust and efficient identification of biomarkers by classifying features on graphs., MOTIVATION: A central problem in biomarker discovery from large-scale gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is the computational challenge of taking into account the dependence among all the features. Methods that ignore the dependence usually identify non-reproducible biomarkers across independent datasets. We introduce a new graph-based semi-supervised feature classification algorithm to identify discriminative disease markers by learning on bipartite graphs. Our algorithm directly classifies the feature nodes in a bipartite graph as positive

We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework

Mining Quantitative Association Rules in Large Relational Tables, We introduce the problem of mining association rules in large relational tables containing both quantitative and categorical attributes. An example of such an association might be &amp;quot;10 % of married people between age 50 and 60 have at least 2 cars&amp;quot;. We deal with quantitative attributes by finepartitioning the values of the attribute and then combining adjacent partitions as necessary. We introduce measures of partial completeness which quantify the information lost due to partitioning. A direct application of this technique can generate too many similar rules. We tackle this problem by using a &amp;quot;greater-than-expected-value &amp;quot; interest measure to identify the interesting rules in the output. We give an algorithm for mining such quantitative association rules. Finally

The relationship between the evolution of microRNA targets and the length of their UTRs, ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNA molecules that modulate the gene expression at the post-transcription levels in many eukaryotic cells. Their widespread and important role in animals is gauged by estimates that ~25% of all genes are miRNA targets. RESULTS: We perform a systematic investigation of the relationship between miRNA regulation and their targets' evolution in two mammals: human and mouse. We find genes with longer 3' UTRs are regulated by more distinct types of miRNAs. These genes correspondingly tend to have slower evolutionary rates at the protein level. Housekeeping genes are another class of genes that evolve slowly. However

Deformable templates using large deformation kinematics, A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods

A new measure for functional similarity of gene products based on Gene Ontology, BACKGROUND:Gene Ontology (GO) is a standard vocabulary of functional terms and allows for coherent annotation of gene products. These annotations provide a basis for new methods that compare gene products regarding their molecular function and biological role.RESULTS:We present a new method for comparing sets of GO terms and for assessing the functional similarity of gene products. The method relies on two semantic similarity measures; simRel and funSim. One measure (simRel) is applied in the comparison of the biological processes found in different groups of organisms. The other measure (funSim) is used to find functionally related gene products within the same or between different genomes. Results indicate that the method

Affective neuroscience and psychophysiology: toward a synthesis., This article reviews the author's program of research on the neural substrates of emotion and affective style and their behavioral and peripheral biological correlates. Two core dimensions along which affect is organized are approach and withdrawal. Some of the key circuitry underlying approach and withdrawal components of emotion is reviewed with an emphasis on the role played by different sectors of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala. Affective style refers to individual differences in valence-specific features of emotional reactivity and regulation. The different parameters of affective style can be objectively measured using specific laboratory probes. Relations between individual differences in prefrontal and amygdala function and specific components of affective style are illustrated. The final section of the article concludes with a brief discussion of plasticity in the central circuitry of emotion and the possibility that this circuitry can be shaped by training experiences that might potentially promote a more resilient

Rebuilding community ecology from functional traits,  There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu.

The excitation of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photo-bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional

Stochastic nature of precisely timed spike patterns in visual system neuronal responses., It is not clear how information related to cognitive or psychological processes is carried by or represented in the responses of single neurons. One provocative proposal is that precisely timed spike patterns play a role in carrying such information. This would require that these spike patterns have the potential for carrying information that would not be available from other measures such as spike count or latency. We examined exactly timed (1-ms precision) triplets and quadruplets of spikes in the stimulus-elicited responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) neurons of the awake fixating rhesus monkey. Large numbers of these precisely timed spike patterns were found. Information theoretical analysis showed that the precisely timed spike patterns carried only information already available from spike count

Symbolic Model Checking: $10^20$ States and Beyond, Many different methods have been devised for automatically verifying finite state systems by examining state-graph models of system behavior. These methods all depend on decision procedures that explicitly represent the state space using a list or a table that grows in proportion to the number of states. We describe a general method that represents the state space symbolically instead of explicitly. The generality of our method comes from using a dialect of the Mu-Calculus as the primary specification language. We describe a model checking algorithm for Mu-Calculus formulas that uses Bryant&#039;s Binary Decision Diagrams (1986) to represent relations and formulas. We then show how our new Mu-Calculus model checking algorithm can be used to derive efficient decision procedures for CTL model checking

Debugging Operating Systems with Time-Traveling Virtual Machines, Operating systems are difficult to debug with traditional cyclic debugging. They are non-deterministic; they run for long periods of time; they interact directly with hardware devices; and their state is easily perturbed by the act of debugging. This paper describes a time-traveling virtual machine that overcomes many of the difficulties associated with debugging operating systems. Time travel enables a programmer to navigate backward and forward arbitrarily through the execution history of a particular run and to replay arbitrary segments of the past execution. We integrate time travel into a general-purpose debugger to enable a programmer to debug an OS in reverse

Construction and analysis of non-Poisson stimulus-response models of neural spiking activity., A paradigm for constructing and analyzing {non-Poisson} stimulus-response models of neural spike train activity is presented. Inhomogeneous gamma {(IG)} and inverse Gaussian {(IIG)} probability models are constructed by generalizing the derivation of the inhomogeneous Poisson {(IP)} model from the exponential probability density. The resultant spike train models have Markov dependence. Quantile-quantile {(Q-Q)} plots and {Kolmogorov-Smirnov} {(K-S)} plots are developed based on the rate-rescaling theorem to assess model goodness-of-fit. The analysis also expresses the spike rate function of the neuron directly in terms of its interspike interval {(ISI)} distribution. The methods are illustrated with an analysis of 34 spike trains from rat {CA1} hippocampal pyramidal neurons recorded while the animal executed a behavioral task. The stimulus in these experiments is the animal's position in its environment and the response is the neural spiking activity. For all 34 pyramidal cells

Predicting Functional Gene Links from Phylogenetic-Statistical Analyses of Whole Genomes, An important element of the developing field of proteomics is to understand protein-protein interactions and other functional links amongst genes. Across-species correlation methods for detecting functional links work on the premise that functionally linked proteins will tend to show a common pattern of presence and absence across a range of genomes. We describe a maximum likelihood statistical model for predicting functional gene linkages. The method detects independent instances of the correlated gain or loss of pairs of proteins on phylogenetic trees

Innate immune recognition of viral infection, Induction of the antiviral innate immune response depends on recognition of viral components by host pattern-recognition receptors. Members of the Toll-like receptor family have emerged as key sensors that recognize viral components such as nucleic acids. Toll-like receptor signaling results in the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines and leads to dendritic cell maturation and establishment of antiviral immunity. Cells also express cytoplasmic RNA helicases that function as alternative pattern-recognition receptors through recognition of double-stranded RNA produced during virus replication. These two classes of pattern-recognition receptor molecules are expressed in different intracellular compartments and induce type I interferon responses via distinct signaling pathways."

The central component of the model is a lattice structure derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics of information flow. The lattice properties permit concise formulations of the security requirements of different existing systems and facilitate the construction of mechanisms that enforce security. The model provides a unifying view of all systems that restrict information flow

Ion-pairs in proteins., A ""working definition"" for an ion-pair has been derived based upon analysis of the distance distributions for like- and oppositely charged groups in 38 proteins. Ion-pairs defined according to this criterion (less than or equal to 4 A between charged groups) have been analysed in respect of: (1) the frequencies of different pair types; (2) the residue separations and secondary structural locations of the residues involved; (3) the flexibility of the side-chains involved; (4) their conformation; (5) their environment (accessibility to solvent and proximity to active site or ligand binding regions); and (6) their conservation in related proteins. The results obtained indicate that on average one-third of the charged residues in a protein are involved in ion-pairs and 76% of these are concerned with stabilizing the tertiary (rather than the secondary) structure. Only 17% of ion-pairs are buried

LexRank: Graph-based Lexical Centrality as Salience in Text Summarization, We introduce a stochastic graph-based method for computing relative importance of textual units for Natural Language Processing.   We test the technique on the problem of  Text  Summarization (TS).  Extractive TS  relies on  the  concept  of  sentence  salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents.

Getting to know you: learning new user preferences in recommender systems, Recommender systems have become valuable resources for users seeking intelligent ways to search through the enormous volume of information available to them. One crucial unsolved problem for recommender systems is how best to learn about a new user. In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system

Quantum Rabi Oscillation: A Direct Test of Field Quantization in a Cavity, We have observed the Rabi oscillation of circular Rydberg atoms in the vacuum and in small coherent fields stored in a high Q cavity. The signal exhibits discrete Fourier components at frequencies proportional to the square root of successive integers. This provides direct evidence of field quantization in the cavity. The weights of the Fourier components yield the photon number distribution in the field. This investigation of the excited levels of the atom-cavity system reveals nonlinear quantum features at extremely low field strengths."

Genome-wide approaches to studying chromatin modifications,  Over two metres of DNA is packaged into each nucleus in the human body in a manner that still allows for gene regulation. This remarkable feat is accomplished by the wrapping of DNA around histone proteins in repeating units of nucleosomes to form a structure known as chromatin. This chromatin structure is subject to various modifications that have profound influences on gene expression. Recently developed techniques to study chromatin modifications at a genome-wide scale are now allowing researchers to probe the complex components that make up epigenomes. Here we review genome-wide approaches to studying epigenomic structure and the exciting findings that have been obtained using these technologies."

An assessment of the uses of homologous interactions, Motivation: Protein-protein interactions have proved to be a valuable starting point for understanding the inner workings of the cell. Computational methodologies have been built which both predict interactions and use interaction datasets in order to predict other protein features. Such methods require gold standard positive (GSP) and negative (GSN) interaction sets. Here we examine and demonstrate the usefulness of homologous interactions in predicting good quality positive and negative interaction datasets. Results: We generate GSP interaction sets as subsets from experimental data using only interaction and sequence information. We can therefore produce sets for several species (many of which at present have no identified GSPs). Comprehensive error rate testing demonstrates the power of the method. We also show how the use of our datasets significantly improves the predictive power of algorithms for interaction prediction and function prediction. Furthermore we generate GSN interaction sets for yeast and examine the use of homology along with other protein properties such as localisation

Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: A Partial Theory, Past analysis of social movements and social movement organizations has normally assumed a close link between the frustrations or grievances of a collectivity of actors and the growth and decline of movement activity. Questioning the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon the social psychology of social movement participants; it can then be more easily integrated with structural theories of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media

Understanding the relationship between searchers' queries and information goals, We describe results from Web search log studies aimed at elucidating user behaviors associated with queries and destination URLs that appear with different frequencies. We note the diversity of information goals that searchers have and the differing ways that goals are specified.

We identify several significant differences in user behavior depending on the rarity of the query and the destination URL. We find that searchers are more likely to be successful when the frequencies of the query and destination URL are similar. We also establish that the behavioral differences observed for queries and goals of varying rarity persist even after accounting for potential confounding variables

How to understand the cell by breaking it: network analysis of gene perturbation screens, Modern high-throughput gene perturbation screens are key technologies at the forefront of genetic research. Combined with rich phenotypic descriptors they enable researchers to observe detailed cellular reactions to experimental perturbations on a genome-wide scale. This review surveys the current state-of-the-art in analyzing perturbation screens from a network point of view. We describe approaches to make the step from the parts list to the wiring diagram by using phenotypes for network inference and integrating them with complementary data sources. The first part of the review describes methods to analyze one- or low-dimensional phenotypes like viability or reporter activity; the second part concentrates on high-dimensional phenotypes showing global changes in cell morphology

The idiots guide to Quantum Error Correction, Quantum Error Correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent arguably the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of Quantum Error Correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However

Scientific data management in the coming decade, This is a thought piece on data-intensive science requirements for databases and science centers. It argues that peta-scale datasets will be housed by science centers that provide substantial storage and processing for scientists who access the data via smart notebooks. Next-generation science instruments and simulations will generate these peta-scale datasets. The need to publish and share data and the need for generic analysis and visualization tools will finally create a convergence on common metadata standards. Database systems will be judged by their support of these metadata standards and by their ability to manage and access peta-scale datasets. The procedural stream-of-bytes-file-centric approach to data analysis is both too cumbersome and too serial for such large datasets. Non-procedural query and analysis of schematized self-describing data is both easier to use and allows much more parallelism."

Managing Variability in Software Architectures, This paper presents experience with explicitly managing variability within a software architecture. Software architects normally plan for change and put mechanisms in the architecture to support those changes. Understanding the situations where change has been planned for and recording the options possible within particular situations is usually not done explicitly. This becomes important if the architecture is used for many product versions over a long period or in a product line context where the architecture is used to build a variety of different products. That is

Control of ion selectivity in potassium channels by electrostatic and dynamic properties of carbonyl ligands, Potassium channels are essential for maintaining a normal ionic balance across cell membranes.

This selectivity arises because the transfer of the K+ ion into the channel pore is energetically favoured

Evolutionary games on graphs, Game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific disciplines from biology to behavioral sciences to economics. In its evolutionary form and especially when the interacting agents are linked in a specific social network the underlying solution concepts and methods are very similar to those applied in non-equilibrium statistical physics. This review gives a tutorial-type overview of the field for physicists. The first four sections introduce the necessary background in classical and evolutionary game theory from the basic definitions to the most important results. The fifth section surveys the topological complications implied by non-mean-field-type social network structures in general. The next three sections discuss in detail the dynamic behavior of three prominent classes of models: the Prisoner's Dilemma

We make use of two different cost functions for Support Vectors: training with (i) an e insensitive loss and (ii) Huber's robust loss function and discuss how to choose the regularization parameters in these models. Two applications are considered: data from (a) a noisy (normal and uniform noise) Mackey Glass equation and (b) the Santa Fe competition (set D). In both cases Support Vector Machines show an excellent performance. In case (b) the Support Vector approach improves the best known result on the benchmark by a factor of 29%."

SI provides a basis with wich it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model. In this paper we present a Swarm Search Algorithm with varying population of agents. The swarm is based on a previous model with fixed population which proved its effectiveness on several computation problems. We will show that the variation of the population size provides the swarm with mechanisms that improves its self-adaptability and causes the emergence of a more robust self-organized behavior

Reproducibility of microarray data: a further analysis of microarray quality control (MAQC) data., BACKGROUND: Many researchers are concerned with the comparability and reliability of microarray gene expression data. Recent completion of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project provides a unique opportunity to assess reproducibility across multiple sites and the comparability across multiple platforms. The MAQC analysis presented for the conclusion of inter- and intra-platform comparability/reproducibility of microarray gene expression measurements is inadequate. We evaluate the reproducibility/comparability of the MAQC data for 12901 common genes in four titration samples generated from five high-density one-color microarray platforms and the TaqMan technology. We discuss some of the problems with the use of correlation coefficient as metric to evaluate the inter- and intra-platform reproducibility and the percent of overlapping genes (POG) as a measure for evaluation of a gene selection procedure by MAQC. RESULTS: A total of 293 arrays were used in the intra- and inter-platform analysis. A hierarchical cluster analysis shows distinct differences in the measured intensities among the five platforms. A number of genes show a small fold-change in one platform and a large fold-change in another platform

This segmentation algorithm uses automatically induced decision rules to combine the different features. The embedded text-based algorithm builds on lexical cohesion and has performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms based on lexical information. A significant error reduction is obtained by combining the two knowledge sources."

Efficient sampling algorithm for estimating subgraph concentrations and detecting network motifs, Summary: Biological and engineered networks have recently been shown to display network motifs: a small set of characteristic patterns that occur much more frequently than in randomized networks with the same degree sequence. Network motifs were demonstrated to play key information processing roles in biological regulation networks. Existing algorithms for detecting network motifs act by exhaustively enumerating all subgraphs with a given number of nodes in the network. The runtime of such algorithms increases strongly with network size. Here

Using OWL to model biological knowledge, Much has been written of the facilities for ontology building and reasoning offered for ontologies expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Less has been written about how the modelling requirements of different areas of interest are met by OWL-DL's underlying model of the world. In this paper we use the disciplines of biology and bioinformatics to reveal the requirements of a community that both needs and uses ontologies. We use a case study of building an ontology of protein phosphatases to show how OWL-DL's model can capture a large proportion of the community's needs. We demonstrate how Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) can extend inherent limitations of this model. We give examples of relationships between more than two instances; lists and exceptions

Fast algorithm for predicting the secondary structure of single-stranded RNA., A computer method is presented for finding the most stable secondary structures in long single-stranded RNAs. It is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing codes. The time required for its application increases as N3 for a chain N nucleotides long. As many as 1000 nucleotides can be searched in a single run. The approach is systematic and builds an optimal structure in a straightforward inductive procedure based on an exact mathematical algorithm. Two simple half-matrices are constructed and the best folded form is read directly from the second matrix by a simple back-tracking procedure. The program utilizes published values for base-pairing energies to compute one structure with the lowest free energy."

Reducing uncertainty in projections of extinction risk from climate change, Aim Concern over the implications of climate change for biodiversity has led to the use of species聳climate 聭envelope聮 models to forecast risks of species extinctions under climate change scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model projections and there remains a need to test the accuracy of models and to reduce uncertainties. Testing of models has been limited by a lack of data against which projections of future ranges can be tested. Here we provide a first test of the predictive accuracy of such models using observed species聮 range shifts and climate change in two periods of the recent past. Location Britain. Methods Observed range shifts for 116 breeding bird species in Britain between 1967 and 1972 (t1) and 1987聳91 (t2) are used. We project range shifts between t1 and t2 for each species based on observed climate using 16 alternative models (4 methods x 2 data parameterizations x 2 rules to transform probabilities of occurrence into presence and absence records). Results Modelling results were extremely variable

The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law

From A to B in free energy space, The authors present a new method for searching low free energy paths in complex molecular systems at finite temperature. They introduce two variables that are able to describe the position of a point in configurational space relative to a preassigned path. With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables

A Bayesian Approach to Joint Feature Selection and Classifier Design, This paper adopts a Bayesian approach to simultaneously learn both an optimal nonlinear classifier and a subset of predictor variables (or features) that are most relevant to the classification task. The approach uses heavy-tailed priors to promote sparsity in the utilization of both basis functions and features; these priors act as regularizers for the likelihood function that rewards good classification on the training data. We derive an expectation- maximization (EM) algorithm to efficiently compute a maximum a posteriori (MAP) point estimate of the various parameters. The algorithm is an extension of recent state-of-the-art sparse Bayesian classifiers

Random Forests, Abstract. Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund &amp; R. Schapire

Heterogeneous uncertainty sampling for supervised learning, Uncertainty sampling methods iteratively request class labels for training instances whose classes are uncertain despite the previous labeled instances.

One problem with this approach is that the classifier best suited for an application may be too expensive to train or use during the selection of instances. We test the use of one classifier (a highly efficient probabilistic one) to select examples for training another (the C4.5 rule induction program). Despite being chosen by this heterogeneous approach

Support vector machine learning for interdependent and structured output spaces, Learning general functional dependencies is one of the main goals in machine learning. Recent progress in kernel-based methods has focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations. This paper addresses the complementary issue of problems involving complex outputs such as multiple dependent output variables and structured output spaces. We propose to generalize multiclass Support Vector Machine learning in a formulation that involves features extracted jointly from inputs and outputs. The resulting optimization problem is solved efficiently by a cutting plane algorithm that exploits the sparseness and structural decomposition of the problem. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method on problems ranging from supervised grammar learning and named-entity recognition
Detection of Logical Coupling Based on Product Release History, During the evolution of a large software system there are requirements to extend  the system since the demands of the customer and the environment grow or  change constantly. Such large systems reach often a high level of complexity. Any  additional extension would take many changes and adaptations in the system. At  that point it is necessary to examine the system and its components concerning  the structural behaviour with respect to the need for restructuring. This master  &#039;s thesis evaluates the software evolution of a Telecommunication Switching  System. All investigations and results are based on release histories of different  decomposition levels and modules stored in a database. The major goal was to  identify &#034;logical coupling&#034; among modules and to determine whether or not this  coupling represents real module dependencies. The author developed a methodology  named &#034;CAESAR.&#034; It consists of two main processes: 1.) The Change  Sequence Analysis (CSA) represents all changes of a..."

Widespread Translational Inhibition by Plant miRNAs and siRNAs, High complementarity between plant miRNAs and their mRNA targets is thought to cause silencing prevalently by endonucleolytic cleavage. We have isolated Arabidopsis mutants defective in miRNA action. Their analysis provides evidence that plant miRNA-guided silencing has a widespread translational inhibitory component that is genetically separable from endonucleolytic cleavage. We further show that the same is true of silencing mediated by short interfering (si)RNA populations. Translational repression is effected in part by the ARGONAUTE proteins AGO1 and AGO10. It also requires the activity of the microtubule-severing enzyme katanin

Distributed Simulation: A Case Study in Design and Verification of Distributed Programs., The problem of system simulation is typically solved in a sequential manner due to the wide and intensive sharing of variables by all parts of the system. We propose a distributed solution where processes communicate only through messages with their neighbors; there are no shared variables and there is no central process for message routing or process scheduling. Deadlock is avoided in this system despite the absence of global control. Each process in the solution requires only a limited amount of memory. The correctness of a distributed system is proven by proving the correctness of each of its component processes and then using inductive arguments. The proposed solution has been empirically found to be efficient in preliminary studies. The paper presents formal

We study the stability properties of large classes of learning algorithms such as regularization based algorithms. In particular we focus on Hilbert space regularization and Kullback-Leibler regularization. We demonstrate how to apply the results to SVM for regression and classification."

The Control of the False Discovery Rate in Multiple Testing under Dependency, Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be<p>the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing prob- <p>lems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure<p>for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful<p>than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error <p>rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery<p>rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of <p>the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition <p>for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of prac- <p>tical interest

Memory Resource Management in VMware ESX Server, VMware ESX Server is a thin software layer designed to multiplex hardware resources efficiently among virtual machines running unmodified commodity operating systems. This paper introduces several novel ESX Server mechanisms and policies for managing memory. A <em>ballooning</em> technique reclaims the pages considered least valuable by the operating system running in a virtual machine. An <em>idle memory tax</em> achieves efficient memory utilization while maintaining performance isolation guarantees. <em>Content-based page sharing</em> and <em>hot I/O page remapping</em> exploit transparent page remapping to eliminate redundancy and reduce copying overheads. These techniques are combined to efficiently support virtual machine workloads that overcommit memory."

Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well

Selective suppression of hippocampal ripples impairs spatial memory, Sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) complexes in the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex are believed to be important for transferring labile memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage. We found that selective elimination of SPW-Rs during post-training consolidation periods resulted in performance impairment in rats trained on a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task. Our results provide evidence for a prominent role of hippocampal SPW-Rs in memory consolidation."
Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions, Bilateral medial temporal lobe resection in man results in a persistent impairment of recent memory whenever the removal is carried far enough posteriorly to damage portions of the anterior hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus. This conclusion is based on formal psychological testing of nine cases (eight psychotic and one epileptic) carried out from one and one-half to four years after operation. The degree of memory loss appears to depend on the extent of hippocampal removal. In two cases in which bilateral resection was carried to a distance of 8 cm posterior to the temporal tips the loss was particularly severe. Removal of only the uncus and amygdala bilaterally does not appear to cause memory impairment. A case of unilateral inferior temporal lobectomy with radical posterior extension to include the major portion of the hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus showed no lasting memory loss. This is consistent with Milner and Penfield's negative findings in a long series of unilateral removals for temporal lobe epilepsy. The memory loss in these cases of medial temporal lobe excision involved both anterograde and some retrograde amnesia

Structural Inertia and Organizational Change, Theory and research on organization-environment relations from a population ecology perspective have been based on the assumption that inertial pressures on structure are strong.

It also considers how the strength of inertial forces varies with age

Creating and managing a high-performance knowledge-sharing network: the Toyota case, Previous research suggests that knowledge diffusion occurs more quickly within Toyotarsquos production network than in competing automaker networks. In this paper we examine the lsquoblack boxrsquo of knowledge sharing within Toyotarsquos network and demonstrate that Toyotarsquos ability to effectively create and manage network-level knowledge-sharing processes at least partially explains the relative productivity advantages enjoyed by Toyota and its suppliers. We provide evidence that suppliers do learn more quickly after participating in Toyotarsquos knowledge-sharing network. Toyotarsquos network has solved three fundamental dilemmas with regard to knowledge sharing by devising methods to (1) motivate members to participate and openly share valuable knowledge (while preventing undesirable spillovers to competitors)

Designing the whyline: a debugging interface for asking questions about program behavior, Debugging is still among the most common and costly of programming activities. One reason is that current debugging tools do not directly support the inquisitive nature of the activity.  Interrogative Debugging  is a new debugging paradigm in which programmers can ask  why did  and even  why didn't  questions directly about their program's runtime failures. The  Whyline  is a prototype Interrogative Debugging interface for the Alice programming environment that visualizes answers in terms of runtime events directly relevant to a programmer's question. Comparisons of identical debugging scenarios from user tests with and without the Whyline showed that the Whyline reduced debugging time by nearly a factor of 8

Mapping the structure of science through usage, Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;Science has traditionally been mapped on the basis of authorship and citation data. Due to publication and citation delays such data represents the structure of science as it existed in the past. We propose to map science by proxy of journal relationships derived from usage data to determine research trends as they presently occur. This mapping is performed by applying a principal components analysis superimposed with a k-means cluster analysis on networks of journal relationships derived from a large set of article usage data collected for the Los Alamos National Laboratory research community. Results indicate that meaningful maps of the interests of a local scientific community can be derived from usage data. Subject groupings in the mappings corresponds to Thomson ISI subject categories. A comparison to maps resulting from the analysis of 2003 Thomson ISI Journal Citation Report data reveals interesting differences between the features of local usage and global citation data."

Mega-phylogeny approach for comparative biology: an alternative to supertree and supermatrix approaches, {BACKGROUND:Biology} has increasingly recognized the necessity to build and utilize larger phylogenies to address broad evolutionary questions. Large phylogenies have facilitated the discovery of differential rates of molecular evolution between trees and herbs. They have helped us understand the diversification patterns of mammals as well as the patterns of seed evolution. In addition to these broad evolutionary questions there is increasing awareness of the importance of large phylogenies for addressing conservation issues such as biodiversity hotspots and response to global change. Two major classes of methods have been employed to accomplish the large tree-building task: supertrees and supermatrices. Although these methods are continually being developed

An empirical study of speed and communication in globally distributed software development, Global software development is rapidly becoming the norm for technology companies. Previous qualitative research suggests that distributed development may increase development cycle time for individual work items (modification requests). We use both data from the source code change management system and survey data to model the extent of delay in a distributed software development organization and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay

3D-Jury: a simple approach to improve protein structure predictions., Motivation: Consensus structure prediction methods (meta-predictors) have higher accuracy than individual structure prediction algorithms (their components). The goal for the development of the {3D-Jury} system is to create a simple but powerful procedure for generating meta-predictions using variable sets of models obtained from diverse sources. The resulting protocol should help to improve the quality of structural annotations of novel proteins. Results: The {3D-Jury} system generates meta-predictions from sets of models created using variable methods. It is not necessary to know prior characteristics of the methods. The system is able to utilize immediately new components (additional prediction providers). The accuracy of the system is comparable with other well-tuned prediction servers. The algorithm resembles methods of selecting models generated using ab initio folding simulations. It is simple and offers a portable solution to improve the accuracy of other protein structure prediction protocols. Availability: The {3D-Jury} system is available via the Structure Prediction Meta Server {(http://BioInfo.PL/Meta/)} to the academic community. Contact: leszek@bioinfo.pl Supplementary information: {3D-Jury} is coupled to the continuous online server evaluation program

Slow Feature Analysis: Unsupervised Learning of Invariances, Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. SFA is based on a non-linear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decorrelated features

Theta phase precession in hippocampal neuronal populations and the compression of temporal sequences, O'Keefe and Recce [1993] Hippocampus 3:317-330 described an interaction between the hippocampal theta rhythm and the spatial firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus: they found that a cell's spike activity advances to earlier phases of the theta cycle as the rat passes through the cell's place field. The present study makes use of large-scale parallel recordings to clarify and extend this finding in several ways: 1) Most CA1 pyramidal cells show maximal activity at the same phase of the theta cycle.

Treadmill training of paraplegic patients using a robotic orthosis, Recent studies have confirmed that regular treadmill training can improve walking capabilities in incomplete spinal cord-injured subjects . At the beginning of this training the leg movements of the patients have to be assisted by physiotherapists during gait on the moving treadmill. The physical capabilities and the individual experience of the therapists usually limit this training. A driven gait orthosis (DGO) has been developed that can move the legs of a patient in a physiological way on the moving treadmill. The orthosis is adjustable in size so different patients can use it. Actuators at the knee and hip joints are controlled by a position controller. With the DGO the legs of patients with different degrees of paresis and spasticity could be trained for more than half an hour

Recent developments combining state-of-the-art force fields with continuum solvation calculations have allowed us to reach the fourth era of MD applications in which one can often derive both accurate structure and accurate relative free energies from molecular dynamics trajectories. We illustrate such applications on nucleic acid duplexes
Digital Preservation: A Time Bomb for Digital Libraries, Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty and expense of preserving digital information is a potential impediment to digital library development. Preservation of traditional materials became more successful and systematic after libraries and archives integrated preservation into overall planning and resource allocation. Digital preservation is largely experimental and replete with the risks associated with untested methods. Digital preservation strategies are shaped by the needs and constraints of repositories with little consideration for the requirements of current and future users of digital scholarly resources. This article discusses the present state of digital preservation

Probability density estimation for the interpretation of neural population codes, 1. Electrophysiological recording data from multiple cells in motor cortex and elsewhere often are interpreted using the population vector method pioneered by Georgopoulos and coworkers. This paper proposes an alternative method for interpreting coding across populations of cells that may succeed under circumstances in which the population vector fails. 2. Population codes are analyzed using probability theory to find the complete conditional probability density of a movement parameter given the firing pattern of a set of cells. 3. The conditional probability density when a single cell fires is proportional to the shape of the cell's tuning curve of firing rate in response to different movement parameters. 4. The conditional density when multiple cells fire is proportional to the product of their tuning curves. 5. Movement parameters can be estimated from the conditional density using statistical maximum likelihood or minimum mean-squared error methods. 6. Simulations show that density estimation correctly finds movement directions for nonuniform distributions of preferred directions and noncosine cell tuning curves

Manifold Regularization: A Geometric Framework for Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Examples, We propose a family of learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization that allows us to exploit the geometry of the marginal distribution. We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework."

It is also shown that full processor utilization can be achieved by dynamically assigning priorities on the basis of their current deadlines. A combination of these two scheduling techniques is also discussed."

Wavelet-domain HMMs are designed with the intrinsic properties of the wavelet transform in mind and provide powerful

A Bayesian Approach to Unsupervised One-Shot Learning of Object Categories, Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires thousands of training examples; this is due to the diversity and richness of object appearance which requires models containing hundreds of parameters. We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating ""generic"" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models

Inhomogeneous Electron Gas, This work is a generalization of the Hohenberg鈥擪ohn鈥擲ham theory of the inhomogeneous electron gas; with emphasis on spin effects. An argument based on quantum electrodynamics is used to express the ground-state energy of a system of interacting electrons as a functional of the current density. Expressions are derived for coefficients appearing in an expansion of the correlation functional in terms of the linear-response functions of the homogeneous system; for a gas of almost constant four-current density. The current density contains a spin-dependent term which leads; in the nonrelativistic limit; to a local potential which is also spin dependent. This potential is applied to the problems of spin splitting of energy bands in ferromagnets and spin-density-wave antiferromagnets. The relations between the present approach; that of Slater; and the collective electron theory of ferromagnetism of Stoner are described."

Reproducibility Distinguishes Conscious from Nonconscious Neural Representations, What qualifies a neural representation for a role in subjective experience? Previous evidence suggests that the duration and intensity of the neural response to a sensory stimulus are factors. We introduce another attribute--the reproducibility of a pattern of neural activity across different episodes--that predicts specific and measurable differences between conscious and nonconscious neural representations independently of duration and intensity. We found that conscious neural activation patterns are relatively reproducible when compared with nonconscious neural activation patterns corresponding to the same perceptual content. This is not adequately explained by a difference in signal-to-noise ratio."

Local regulatory variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae., Naturally occurring sequence variation that affects gene expression is an important source of phenotypic differences among individuals within a species. We and others have previously shown that such regulatory variation can occur both at the same locus as the gene whose expression it affects (local regulatory variation) and elsewhere in the genome at trans-acting factors. Here we present a detailed analysis of genome-wide local regulatory variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used genetic linkage analysis to show that nearly a quarter of all yeast genes contain local regulatory variation between two divergent strains. We measured allele-specific expression in a diploid hybrid of the two strains for 77 genes showing strong self-linkage and found that in 52%-78% of these genes

Correlated mutations and residue contacts in proteins, Abstract 10.1002/prot.340180402.abs The maintenance of protein function and structure constrains the evolution of amino acid sequences. This fact can be exploited to interpret correlated mutations observed in a sequence family as an indication of probable physical contact in three dimensions. Here we present a simple and general method to analyze correlations in mutational behavior between different positions in a multiple sequence alignment. We then use these correlations to predict contact maps for each of 11 protein families and compare the result with the contacts determined by crystallography. For the most strongly correlated residue pairs predicted to be in contact

The Competitive Advantage of Sanctioning Institutions, Understanding the fundamental patterns and determinants of human cooperation and the maintenance of social order in human societies is a challenge across disciplines. The existing empirical evidence for the higher levels of cooperation when altruistic punishment is present versus when it is absent systematically ignores the institutional competition inherent in human societies. Whether punishment would be deliberately adopted and would similarly enhance cooperation when directly competing with nonpunishment institutions is highly controversial in light of recent findings on the detrimental effects of punishment. We show experimentally that a sanctioning institution is the undisputed winner in a competition with a sanction-free institution. Despite initial aversion

Social network analysis for routing in disconnected delay-tolerant MANETs, Message delivery in sparse Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is difficult due to the fact that the network graph is rarely (if ever) connected. A key challenge is to find a route that can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move freely. This paper presents a multidisciplinary solution based on the consideration of the socalled small world dynamics which have been proposed for economy and social studies and have recently revealed to be a successful approach to be exploited for characterising information propagation in wireless networks. To this purpose

Automatic clustering of orthologs and in-paralogs from pairwise species comparisons., Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms. It is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional information between genes in different organisms with a high degree of reliability. For example
LOCUS: learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation, We address the problem of learning object class models and object segmentations from unannotated images. We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image

File-access characteristics of parallel scientific workloads, <p><b>Abstract</b>&#8212;Phenomenal improvements in the computational performance of multiprocessors have not been matched by comparable gains in I/O system performance. This imbalance has resulted in I/O becoming a significant bottleneck for many scientific applications. One key to overcoming this bottleneck is improving the performance of multiprocessor file systems. The design of a high-performance multiprocessor file system requires a comprehensive understanding of the expected workload. Unfortunately

Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain, There has been a long controversy as to whether subjectively 'free' decisions are determined by brain activity ahead of time. We found that the outcome of a decision can be encoded in brain activity of prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 10 s before it enters awareness. This delay presumably reflects the operation of a network of high-level control areas that begin to prepare an upcoming decision long before it enters awareness."

Random Walks on Directed Networks: the Case of PageRank, PageRank
Aibo's first words : The social learning of language and meaning, This paper explores the hypothesis that language communication in its very first stage is bootstrapped in a social learning process under the strong influence of culture. A concrete framework for social learning has been de- veloped based on the notion of a language game. Autonomous robots have been programmed to behave according to this framework. We show ex- periments that demonstrate why there has to be a causal role of language on category acquisition; partly by showing that it leads effectively to the bootstrapping of communication and partly by showing that other forms of learning do not generate categories usable in communication or make infor- mation assumptions which cannot be satisfied."

The surprising power of neighborly advice, Two experiments revealed that (i) people can more accurately predict their affective reactions to a future event when they know how a neighbor in their social network reacted to the event than when they know about the event itself and (ii) people do not believe this. Undergraduates made more accurate predictions about their affective reactions to a 5-minute speed date (n = 25) and to a peer evaluation (n = 88) when they knew only how another undergraduate had reacted to these events than when they had information about the events themselves. Both participants and independent judges mistakenly believed that predictions based on information about the event would be more accurate than predictions based on information about how another person had reacted to it. 10.1126/science.1166632"

Phase-of-Firing Coding of Natural Visual Stimuli in Primary Visual Cortex,  SummaryWe investigated the hypothesis that neurons encode rich naturalistic stimuli in terms of their spike times relative to the phase of ongoing network fluctuations rather than only in terms of their spike count. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit spikes from the primary visual cortex of anaesthetized macaques while binocularly presenting a color movie. We found that both the spike counts and the low-frequency LFP phase were reliably modulated by the movie and thus conveyed information about it. Moreover

PocketMatch: A new algorithm to compare binding sites in protein structures, BACKGROUND:Recognizing similarities and deriving relationships among protein molecules is a fundamental requirement in present-day biology. Similarities can be present at various levels which can be detected through comparison of protein sequences or their structural folds. In some cases similarities obscure at these levels could be present merely in the substructures at their binding sites. Inferring functional similarities between protein molecules by comparing their binding sites is still largely exploratory and not as yet a routine protocol. One of the main reasons for this is the limitation in the choice of appropriate analytical tools that can compare binding sites with high sensitivity. To benefit from the enormous amount of structural data that is being rapidly accumulated

Non-parametric model for background subtraction, Abstract. Background subtraction is a method typically used to segment moving regions in image sequences taken from a static camera by comparing each new frame to a model of the scene background. We present anovel non-parametric background model and a background subtraction approach. The model can handle situations where the background of the scene is cluttered and not completely static but contains small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of moving targets. We also show how the model can use color information to suppress detection of shadows. The implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach achieves very sensitive detection with very low false alarm rates. Key words: visual motion

Neural basis of a perceptual decision in the parietal cortex (area LIP) of the rhesus monkey., We recorded the activity of single neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in previous investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial

Perception is the delivery of information in analog form (experience) for conceptual utilization by cognitive mechanisms. The final chapters attempt to develop a theory of meaning (or belief content) by viewing meaning as a certain kind of information-carrying role.}"

Constraining Theories of Embodied Cognition, Influences of perceptual and motor activity on evaluation have led to theories of embodied cognition suggesting that putatively complex judgments can be carried out using only perceptual and motor representations. We present an experiment that revisited a movement-compatibility effect in which people are faster to respond to positive words by pulling a lever than by pushing a lever and are faster to respond to negative words by pushing than by pulling. We demonstrate that the compatibility effect depends on people's representation of their selves in space rather than on their physical location. These data suggest that accounting for embodied phenomena requires understanding the complex interplay between perceptual and motor representations and people's representations of their selves in space."

The Expansion of the Metazoan MicroRNA Repertoire., ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs have been identified as crucial regulators in both animals and plants. Here we report on a comprehensive comparative study of all known miRNA families in animals. We expand the \texttt{MicroRNA Registry 6.0} by more than 1000 new homologs of miRNA precursors whose expression has been verified in at least one species. Using this uniform data basis we analyze their evolutionary history in terms of individual gene phylogenies and in terms of preservation of genomic nearness across species. This allows us to reliably identify microRNA clusters that are derived from a common transcript. RESULTS: We identify three episodes of microRNA innovation that correspond to major developmental innovations: A class of about 20 miRNAs is common to protostomes and deuterostomes and might be related to the advent of bilaterians. A second large wave of innovations maps to the branch leading to the vertebrates. The third significant outburst of miRNA innovation coincides with placental (eutherian) mammals. In addition

Modulation of connectivity in visual pathways by attention: cortical interactions evaluated with structural equation modelling and fMRI, Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have shown that attention to visual motion can increase the responsiveness of the motion-selective cortical area V5 and the posterior parietal cortex (PP). Increased or decreased activation in a cortical area is often attributed to attentional modulation of the cortical projections to that area. This leads to the notion that attention is associated with changes in connectivity. We have addressed attentional modulation of effective connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Three subjects were scanned under identical stimulus conditions (visual motion) while varying only the attentional component of the task. Haemodynamic responses defined an occipito-parieto-frontal network

Adaptive evolution of transcription factor binding sites, BACKGROUND: The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene.

Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes

Text classification and named entities for new event detection, New Event Detection is a challenging task that still offers scope for great improvement after years of effort. In this paper we show how performance on New Event Detection (NED) can be improved by the use of text classification techniques as well as by using named entities in a new way. We explore modifications to the document representation in a vector space-based NED system. We also show that addressing named entities preferentially is useful only in certain situations. A combination of all the above results in a multi-stage NED system that performs much better than baseline single-stage NED systems."

Virtual community attraction: Why people hang out online, Abstract Understanding the attraction of virtual communities is crucial to organizations that want to tap into their enormous information potential. Existing literature theorizes that people join virtual communities to exchange information and/or social support. Theories of broader Internet use have indicated both entertainment and searching for friendship as motivational forces. This exploratory study empirically examines the importance of these reasons in assessing why people come to virtual communities by directly asking virtual community members why they joined. The responses to the open-ended question ""Why did you join?"" were categorized based upon the reasons suggested in the literature. Across 27 communities in 5 different broad types

Accuracy and Power of Statistical Methods for Detecting Adaptive Evolution in Protein Coding Sequences and for Identifying Positively Selected Sites, The parsimony method of SUZUKI and GOJOBORI (1999) and the maximum likelihood method developed from the work of NIELSEN and YANG (1998) are two widely used methods for detecting positive selection in homologous protein coding sequences. Both methods consider an excess of nonsynonymous (replacement) substitutions as evidence for positive selection. Previously published simulation studies comparing the performance of the two methods show contradictory results. Here we conduct a more thorough simulation study to cover and extend the parameter space used in previous studies. We also reanalyzed an HLA data set that was previously proposed to cause problems when analyzed using the maximum likelihood method. Our new simulations and a reanalysis of the HLA data demonstrate that the maximum likelihood method has good power and accuracy in detecting positive selection over a wide range of parameter values. Previous studies reporting poor performance of the method appear to be due to numerical problems in the optimization algorithms and did not reflect the true performance of the method. The parsimony method has a very low rate of false positives but very little power for detecting positive selection or identifying positively selected sites. 10.1534/genetics.104.031153"

Generating Coherent Patterns of Activity from Chaotic Neural Networks,  Summary Neural circuits display complex activity patterns both spontaneously and when responding to a stimulus or generating a motor output. How are these two forms of activity related? We develop a procedure called FORCE learning for modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired activity patterns. FORCE learning works even though the networks we train are spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during learning. Using this approach

Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants, 10.1098/rspb.2002.2210 We show how the movement rules of individual ants on trails can lead to a collective choice of direction and the formation of distinct traffic lanes that minimize congestion. We develop and evaluate the results of a new model with a quantitative study of the behaviour of the army ant Eciton burchelli. Colonies of this species have up to 200 000 foragers and transport more than 3000 prey items per hour over raiding columns that exceed 100 m. It is an ideal species in which to test the predictions of our model because it forms pheromone trails that are densely populated with very swift ants. The model explores the influences of turning rates and local perception on traffic flow. The behaviour of real army ants is such that they occupy the specific region of parameter space in which lanes form and traffic flow is maximized."

Here we report the rational design of new AmPs that show limited homology to naturally occurring proteins but have strong bacteriostatic activity against several species of bacteria
Modeling protein conformational ensembles: From missing loops to equilibrium fluctuations, Characterizing protein flexibility is an important goal for understanding the physical-chemical principles governing biological function. This paper presents a Fragment Ensemble Method to capture the mobility of a protein fragment such as a missing loop and its extension into a Protein Ensemble Method to characterize the mobility of an entire protein at equilibrium. The underlying approach in both methods is to combine a geometric exploration of conformational space with a statistical mechanics formulation to generate an ensemble of physical conformations on which thermodynamic quantities can be measured as ensemble averages. The Fragment Ensemble Method is validated by applying it to characterize loop mobility in both instances of strongly stable and disordered loop fragments. In each instance

Protein Complex Evolution Does Not Involve Extensive Network Rewiring, The formation of proteins into stable protein complexes plays a fundamental role in the operation of the cell. The study of the degree of evolutionary conservation of protein complexes between species and the evolution of protein-protein interactions has been hampered by lack of comprehensive coverage of the high-throughput (HTP) technologies that measure the interactome. We show that new high-throughput datasets on protein co-purification in yeast have a substantially lower false negative rate than previous datasets when compared to known complexes. These datasets are therefore more suitable to estimate the conservation of protein complex membership than hitherto possible. We perform comparative genomics between curated protein complexes from human and the HTP data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the evolution of co-complex memberships. This analysis revealed that out of the 5

Network thermodynamics and complexity: a transition to relational systems theory., Most systems of interest in today's world are highly structured and highly interactive. They cannot be reduced to simple components without losing a great deal of their system identity. Network thermodynamics is a marriage of classical and non-equilibrium thermodynamics along with network theory and kinetics to provide a practical framework for handling these systems. The ultimate result of any network thermodynamic model is still a set of state vector equations. But these equations are built in a new informative way so that information about the organization of the system is identifiable in the structure of the equations. The domain of network thermodynamics is all of physical systems theory. By using the powerful circuit simulator

Mining newsgroups using networks arising from social behavior, Recent advances in information retrieval over hyperlinked corpora have convincingly demonstrated that links carry less noisy information than text. We investigate the feasibility of applying link-based methods in new applications domains. The specific application we consider is to partition authors into opposite camps within a given topic in the context of newsgroups. A typical newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author. This social behavior gives rise to a network in which the vertices are individuals and the links represent ""responded-to"" relationships. An interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a message when they disagree than when they agree. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the WWW link graph

Human subtelomeres are hot spots of interchromosomal recombination and segmental duplication., Human subtelomeres are polymorphic patchworks of interchromosomal segmental duplications at the ends of chromosomes. Here we provide evidence that these patchworks arose recently through repeated translocations between chromosome ends. We assess the relative contribution of the principal mechanisms of ectopic DNA repair to the formation of subtelomeric duplications and find that non-homologous end-joining predominates. Once subtelomeric duplications arise
From presentation to interaction: new goals for online learning technologies, Educators have used online technology in the past as information presentation tools and information storage tools to support learning. Researchers identify online technologies with large capacities and capabilities to enhance human learning in an interactive fashion. Online learning technology should move away from the use of computer technology as presentation and storage tools and advance to the next level by using them as interactive tools. Emerging technologies should be implemented with advanced and sound instruction to promote interactive learning by engaging learners in actively analysing information and knowledge construction and applying technology to support their decision-making.

An integrative genomics approach to infer causal associations between gene expression and disease., A key goal of biomedical research is to elucidate the complex network of gene interactions underlying complex traits such as common human diseases. Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent

We examined the activity of single dopamine neurons during a task in which subjects learned by trial and error when to make an eye movement for a juice reward. We found that these neurons encoded the difference between the current reward and a weighted average of previous rewards
Neurons with graded response have collective computational properties like those of two-state neurons, A model for a large network of ""neurons"" with a graded response (or sigmoid input-output relation) is studied. This deterministic system has collective properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological ""neurons."" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations

This structure forms a 鈥渓eft-handed鈥?medium; for which it has been predicted that such phenomena as the Doppler effect; Cherenkov radiation; and even Snell's law are inverted. It is now possible through microwave experiments to test for these effects using this new metamaterial."
Determining semantic similarity among entity classes from different ontologies, Semantic similarity measures play an important role in information retrieval and information integration. Traditional approaches to modeling semantic similarity compute the semantic distance between definitions within a single ontology. This single ontology is either a domain-independent ontology or the result of the integration of existing ontologies. We present an approach to computing semantic similarity that relaxes the requirement of a single ontology and accounts for differences in the levels of explicitness and formalization of the different ontology specifications. A similarity function determines similar entity classes by using a matching process over synonym sets
Four stages of a scientific discipline; four types of scientist, In this article I propose the classification of the evolutionary stages that a scientific discipline evolves through and the type of scientists that are the most productive at each stage.

To do this they have to introduce a new language adequately describing the subject matter. At stage two

Synchronous Data Flow, Data flow is a natural paradigm for describing DSP applications for concurrent implementation on parallel hardware. Data flow programs for signal processing are directed graphs where each node represents a function and each arc represents a signal path. Synchronous data flow (SDF) is a special case of data flow (either atomic or large grain) in which the number of data samples produced or consumed by each node on each invocation is specified a priori. Nodes can be scheduled statically (at compile time) onto single or parallel programmable processors so the run-time overhead usually associated with data flow evaporates. Multiple sample rates within the same system are easily and naturally handled. Conditions for correctness of SDF graph are explained and scheduling algorithms are described for homogeneous parallel processors sharing memory. A preliminary SDF software system for automatically generating assembly language code for DSP microcomputers is described. Two new efficiency techniques are introduced

Direct evaluation of thermal fluctuations in proteins using a single-parameter harmonic potential., BACKGROUND: An elastic network model is proposed for the interactions between closely (< or = 7.0 A) located alpha-carbon pairs in folded proteins. A single-parameter harmonic potential is adopted for the fluctuations of residues about their mean positions in the crystal structure. The model is based on writing the Kirchhoff adjacency matrix for a protein defining the proximity of residues in space. The elements of the inverse of the Kirchhoff matrix give directly the auto-correlations or cross-correlations of atomic fluctuations. RESULTS: The temperature factors of the C alpha atoms of 12 X-ray structures

Mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance, SUMMARY [last paragraphs of the paper]  The distribution of the numbers of virus resistant bacteria in series of similar cultures of a virus-sensitive strain has been analyzed theoretically on the basis of two current hypotheses concerning the origin of the resistant bacteria.  The distribution has been studied experimentally and has been found to conform with the conclusions drawn from the hypothesis that the resistant bacteria arise by mutations of sensitive cells independently of the action of virus.  The mutation rate has been determined experimentally."

Transgenic inhibition of synaptic transmission reveals role of CA3 output in hippocampal learning., The hippocampus is an area of the brain involved in learning and memory. It contains parallel excitatory pathways referred to as the trisynaptic pathway (which carries information as follows: entorhinal cortex --> dentate gyrus --> CA3 --> CA1 --> entorhinal cortex) and the monosynaptic pathway (entorhinal cortex --> CA1 --> entorhinal cortex). We developed a generally applicable tetanus toxin-based method for transgenic mice that permits inducible and reversible inhibition of synaptic transmission and applied it to the trisynaptic pathway while preserving transmission in the monosynaptic pathway. We found that synaptic output from CA3 in the trisynaptic pathway is dispensable and the short monosynaptic pathway is sufficient for incremental spatial learning. In contrast

Mechanisms of gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is an important regulator of gene expression in many eukaryotes. It triggers different types of gene silencing that are collectively referred to as RNA silencing or RNA interference. A key step in known silencing pathways is the processing of dsRNAs into short RNA duplexes of characteristic size and structure. These short dsRNAs guide RNA silencing by specific and distinct mechanisms. Many components of the RNA silencing machinery still need to be identified and characterized

Boundary-Work and the Demarcation of Science from Non-Science: Strains and Interests in Professional Ideologies of Scientists, The demarcation of science from other intellectual activities-long an analytic problem for philosophers and sociologists-is here examined as a practical problem for scientists. Construction of a boundary between science and varieties of non-science is useful for scientists' pursuit of professional goals: acquisition of intellectual authority and career opportunities; denial of these resources to ""pseudoscientists""; and protection of the autonomy of scientific research from political interference. ""Boundary-work"" describes an ideological style found in scientists' attempts to create a public image for science by contrasting it favorably to non-scientific intellectual or technical activities. Alternative sets of characteristics available for ideological attribution to science reflect ambivalences or strains within the institution: science can be made to look empirical or theoretical
Attention and the detection of signals, Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However

Seven Myths of Formal Methods, Seven widely held conceptions about formal methods are challenged. These beliefs are variants of the following: formal methods can guarantee that software is perfect; they work by proving that the programs are correct; only highly critical systems benefit from their use; they involve complex mathematics; they increase the cost of development; they are incomprehensible to clients; and nobody uses them for real projects. The arguments are based on the author's experiences. They address the bounds of formal methods
Hierarchical ordering of sequential processes, One of the primary functions of an operating system is to rebuild a machine that must be regarded as non-deterministic (on account of cycle stealing and interrupts) into a more or less deterministic automaton.

An analysis of the requirements of the correctness proofs will give us an insight into the logical issues at hand. A ``director-secretary'' relationship will be introduced to reflect a possible discipline in the use of sequencing primitives."

These algorithms use a simple and elegant  technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming relaxation. This  relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and as an eigenvalue minimization  problem. The best previously known approximation..."

Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering, We present a novel algorithm for agglomerative  hierarchical clustering based on evaluating  marginal likelihoods of a probabilistic  model. This algorithm has several advantages  over traditional distance-based agglomerative  clustering algorithms. (1) It defines  a probabilistic model of the data which can  be used to compute the predictive distribution  of a test point and the probability of it  belonging to any of the existing clusters in  the tree. (2) It uses a model-based criterion  to decide on merging clusters rather than an  ad-hoc distance metric. (3) Bayesian hypothesis  testing is used to decide which merges  are advantageous and to output the recommended  depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm  can be interpreted as a novel fast bottom-up  approximate inference method for a Dirichlet  process (i.e. countably infinite) mixture  model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound  on the marginal likelihood of a DPM by summing  over exponentially many clusterings of  the data in polynomial time. We describe  procedures for learning the model hyperparameters

A quantitative model for linking two disparate sets of articles in MEDLINE, Background: Identifying information that implicitly links two disparate sets of articles is a fundamental and intuitive data mining strategy that can help investigators address real scientific questions. The Arrowsmith two-node search finds title words and phrases (so-called B-terms) that are shared across two sets of articles within MEDLINE and displays them in a manner that facilitates human assessment. A serious stumbling-block has been the lack of a quantitative model for predicting which of the hundreds if not thousands of B-terms computed for a given search are most likely to be relevant to the investigator.  Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a public two-node search interface

Lengths of Chromosomal Segments Conserved since Divergence of Man and Mouse, Linkage relationships of homologous loci in man and mouse were used to estimate the mean length of autosomal segments conserved during evolution. Comparison of the locations of greater than 83 homologous loci revealed 13 conserved segments. Map distances between the outermost markers of these 13 segments are known for the mouse and range from 1 to 24 centimorgans. Methods were developed for using this sample of conserved segments to estimate the mean length of all conserved autosomal segments in the genome. This mean length was estimated to be 8.1 +/- 1.6 centimorgans. Evidence is presented suggesting that chromosomal rearrangements that determine the lengths of these segments are randomly distributed within the genome. The estimated mean length of conserved segments was used to predict the probability that certain loci

Secondary Structure Prediction for Aligned RNA Sequences, Most functional RNA molecules have characteristic secondary structures that are highly conserved in evolution. Here we present a method for computing the consensus structure of a set aligned RNA sequences taking into account both thermodynamic stability and sequence covariation. Comparison with phylogenetic structures of rRNAs shows that a reliability of prediction of more than 80% is achieved for only five related sequences. As an application we show that the Early Noduline mRNA contains significant secondary structure that is supported by sequence covariation."

More than the sum of its members: challenges for group recommender systems, Systems that recommend items to a group of two or more users raise a number of challenging issues that are so far only partly understood. This paper identifies four of these issues and points out that they have been dealt with to only a limited extent in the group recommender systems that have been developed so far. The issues are especially important in settings where group members specify their preferences explicitly and where they are not able to engage in face-to-face interaction. We illustrate some of the solutions discussed with reference to the TRAVEL DECISION FORUM prototype. The issues concern (a) the design of suitable preference elicitation and aggregation methods

Simple BM25 extension to multiple weighted fields, This paper describes a simple way of adapting the BM25 ranking formula to deal with structured documents. In the past it has been common to compute scores for the individual fields (e.g. title and body) independently and then combine these scores (typically linearly) to arrive at a final score for the document. We highlight how this approach can lead to poor performance by breaking the carefully constructed non-linear saturation of term frequency in the BM25 function. We propose a much more intuitive alternative which weights term frequencies <i>before</i> the non-linear term frequency saturation function is applied. In this scheme

Web search personalization with ontological user profiles, Every user has a distinct background and a specific goal when searching for information on the Web. The goal of Web search personalization is to tailor search results to a particular user based on that user's interests and preferences. Effective personalization of information access involves two important challenges: accurately identifying the user context and organizing the information in such a way that matches the particular context. We present an approach to personalized search that involves building models of user context as ontological profiles by assigning implicitly derived interest scores to existing concepts in a domain ontology. A spreading activation algorithm is used to maintain the interest scores based on the user's ongoing behavior. Our experiments show that re-ranking the search results based on the interest scores and the semantic evidence in an ontological user profile is effective in presenting the most relevant results to the user."

Bias in error estimation when using cross-validation for model selection, ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. RESULTS: We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created

On the diversity of physicochemical environments experienced by identical ligands in binding pockets of unrelated proteins., Most function prediction methods that identify cognate ligands from binding site analyses work on the assumption of molecular complementarity. These approaches build on the conjectured complementarity of geometrical and physicochemical properties between ligands and binding sites so that similar binding sites will bind similar ligands. We found that this assumption does not generally hold for protein-ligand interactions and observed that it is not the chemical composition of ligand molecules that dictates the complementarity between protein and ligand molecules

An efficient method to identify differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments., Motivation: Microarray experiments typically analyze thousands to tens of thousands of genes from small numbers of biological replicates. The fact that genes are normally expressed in functionally relevant patterns suggests that gene-expression data can be stratified and clustered into relatively homogenous groups. Cluster-wise dimensionality reduction should make it feasible to improve screening power while minimizing information loss. Results: We propose a powerful and computationally simple method for finding differentially expressed genes in small microarray experiments. The method incorporates a novel stratification-based tight clustering algorithm

An analysis of hub proteins identified intermodular hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners in a tissue-restricted manner and intramodular hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners in all or most tissues. Substantial differences in biochemical structure were observed between the two types of hubs. Signaling domains were found more often in intermodular hub proteins

Prediction of hot spot residues at protein-protein interfaces by combining machine learning and energy-based methods, BACKGROUND:Alanine scanning mutagenesis is a powerful experimental methodology for investigating the structural and energetic characteristics of protein complexes. Individual amino-acids are systematically mutated to alanine and changes in free energy of binding (DeltaDeltaG) measured. Several experiments have shown that protein-protein interactions are critically dependent on just a few residues (""hot spots"") at the interface. Hot spots make a dominant contribution to the free energy of binding and if mutated they can disrupt the interaction. As mutagenesis studies require significant experimental efforts

Automatic Document Metadata Extraction Using Support Vector Machines, Automatic metadata generation provides scalability and usability for digital libraries and their collections. Machine learning methods offer robust and adaptable automatic metadata extraction. We describe a support vector machine classification-based method for metadata extraction from header part of research papers and show that it outperforms other machine learning methods on the same task. The method first classifies each line of the header into one or more of 15 classes. An iterative convergence procedure is then used to improve the line classification by using the predicted class labels of its neighbor lines in the previous round. Further metadata extraction is done by seeking the best chunk boundaries of each line. We found that discovery and use of the structural patterns of the data and domain based word clustering can improve the metadata extraction performance. An appropriate feature normalization also greatly improves the classification performance. Our metadata extraction method was originally designed to improve the metadata extraction quality of the digital libraries Citeseer [S. Lawrence et al.

We present a formalism that is able to cope simultaneously with the problem of search and the congestion effects that arise when parallel searches are performed; and we obtain expressions for the average  search cost  both in the presence and the absence of congestion. This formalism is used to obtain optimal network structures for a system using a local search algorithm. It is found that only two classes of networks can be optimal: starlike configurations; when the number of parallel searches is small; and homogeneous-isotropic configurations; when it is large."

We propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there are over 45

The measurement of observer agreement for categorical data, This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of multivariate categorical data arising from observer reliability studies. The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature."

The digital divide: the special case of gender, Abstract This paper examines the evidence for the digital divide based on gender. An overview of research published in the last 20 years draws to the conclusion that females are at a disadvantage relative to men when learning about computers or learning other material with the aid of computer-assisted software. The evidence shows that the digital divide affects people of all ages and across international boundaries. We suggest that the digital divide is fundamentally a problem of computer anxiety whose roots are deep in socialization patterns of boys and girls and that interact with the stereotype of computers as toys for boys. A model of the digital divide is presented that examines gender stereotypes

Space-Time Approach to Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated here in a different way. It is; however; mathematically equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions; one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path  x ( t ) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions; one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of 鈩? for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching  x ;  t  from the past is the wave function 蠄( x ;聽 t ). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated; in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics."

Collegial decision making based on social amplification leads to optimal group formation., Group-living animals are often faced with choosing between one or more alternative resource sites. A central question in such collective decision making includes determining which individuals induce the decision and when. This experimental and theoretical study of shelter selection by cockroach groups demonstrates that choices can emerge through nonlinear interaction dynamics between equal individuals without perfect knowledge or leadership. We identify a simple mechanism whereby a decision is taken on the move with limited information and signaling and without comparison of available opportunities.

We formulate model complexity in terms of the geometry of the space of probability distributions. Geometric complexity provides a clear intuitive understanding of several extant notions of model complexity. This approach allows us to reconceptualize the model selection problem as one of counting explanations that lie close to the 鈥樷€榯ruth.鈥欌€?We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying it to the recovery of models in psychophysics."

Linking spontaneous activity of single cortical neurons and the underlying functional architecture., The relation between the activity of a single neocortical neuron and the dynamics of the network in which it is embedded was explored by single-unit recordings and real-time optical imaging. The firing rate of a spontaneously active single neuron strongly depends on the instantaneous spatial pattern of ongoing population activity in a large cortical area. Very similar spatial patterns of population activity were observed both when the neuron fired spontaneously and when it was driven by its optimal stimulus. The evoked patterns could be used to reconstruct the spontaneous activity of single neurons."

Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks, Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require  a priori  information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far."

Coarse-Grained MD Simulations of Membrane Protein-Bilayer Self-Assembly, Summary Complete determination of a membrane protein structure requires knowledge of the protein position within the lipid bilayer. As the number of determined structures of membrane proteins increases so does the need for computational methods which predict their position in the lipid bilayer. Here we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach to lipid bilayer self-assembly around membrane proteins. We demonstrate that this method can be used to predict accurately the protein position in the bilayer for membrane proteins with a range of different sizes and architectures."

Design of multistable RNA molecules., We show that the problem of designing RNA sequences that can fold into multiple stable secondary structures can be transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem that can be solved by means of simple heuristics. Hence it is feasible to design RNA switches with prescribed structural alternatives. We discuss the theoretical background and present an efficient tool that allows the design of various types of switches. We argue that both the general properties of the sequence structure map of RNA secondary structures and the ease with which our design tool finds bistable RNAs strongly indicates that RNA switches are easily accessible in evolution. Thus conformational switches are yet another function for which RNA can be employed."

Identifying cis-regulatory modules by combining comparative and compositional analysis of DNA., Motivation: Predicting cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in higher eukaryotes is a challenging computational task. Commonly used methods to predict CRMs based on the signal of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are limited by prior information about transcription factor specificity. More general methods that bypass the reliance on TFBS models are needed for comprehensive CRM prediction.  Results: We have developed a method to predict CRMs called CisPlusFinder that identifies high density regions of perfect local ungapped sequences (PLUSs) based on multiple species conservation. By assuming that PLUSs contain core TFBS motifs that are locally overrepresented

Object Recognition with Features Inspired by Visual Cortex, We introduce a novel set of features for robust object recognition. Each element of this set is a complex feature obtained by combining position- and scale-tolerant edge-detectors over neighboring positions and multiple orientations. Our system&#253;s architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

Three qubits can be entangled in two inequivalent ways, {Invertible local transformations of a multipartite system are used to define equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly; we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system; this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement; for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular; we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems; for all of which we show that; typically; two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC; not even with a small probability of success.}"

We examine the relationship between network architecture and diffusion performance. We consider the space of structures that fall between

Algorithms from each of these classes are briefly described and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed. 1 Introduction Recently
Sparse coding and decorrelation in primary visual cortex during natural vision, Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons

Quorum Sensing in Bacteria, 鈻?Abstract鈥?Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities. These processes include symbiosis
On the Convergence Properties of the EM Algorithm, Two convergence aspects of the EM algorithm are studied: (i) does the EM algorithm find a local maximum or a stationary value of the (incomplete-data) likelihood function? (ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space

Effects of Diffusion on Free Precession in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments, Nuclear resonance techniques involving free precession are examined; and; in particular; a convenient variation of Hahn's spin-echo method is described. This variation employs a combination of pulses of different intensity or duration (""90-degree"" and ""180-degree"" pulses). Measurements of the transverse relaxation time  T 2  in fluids are often severely compromised by molecular diffusion. Hahn's analysis of the effect of diffusion is reformulated and extended; and a new scheme for measuring  T 2  is described which; as predicted by the extended theory; largely circumvents the diffusion effect. On the other hand; the free precession technique; applied in a different way; permits a direct measurement of the molecular self-diffusion constant in suitable fluids. A measurement of the self-diffusion constant of water at 25掳C is described which yields  D =2.5(卤0.3)脳10 -5  cm 2 /sec; in good agreement with previous determinations. An analysis of the effect of convection on free precession is also given. A null method for measuring the longitudinal relaxation time  T 1 ; based on the unequal-pulse technique; is described."

We outline for a number of problem classes
The 21-nucleotide let-7 RNA regulates developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans, The C. elegans heterochronic gene pathway consists of a cascade of regulatory genes that are temporally controlled to specify the timing of developmental events1.

We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material

We also know that functional differences between duplicate genes can originate in several different ways

Combining Collaborative Filtering with Personal Agents for better Recommendations, Information filtering agents and collaborative filtering both attempt to alleviate information overload by identifying which items a user will find worthwhile. Information filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined. This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the CF framework select the best ones for them."

Ligand binding affinities from MD simulations., PMID: 12069620 Simplified free energy calculations based on force field energy estimates of ligand鈭抮eceptor interactions and thermal conformational sampling have emerged as a useful tool in structure-based ligand design. Here we give an overview of the linear interaction energy (LIE) method for calculating ligand binding free energies from molecular dynamics simulations. A notable feature is that the binding energetics can be predicted by considering only the intermolecular interactions of the ligand in the associated and dissociated states. The approximations behind this approach are examined
Limits on the memory storage capacity of bounded synapses., Memories maintained in patterns of synaptic connectivity are rapidly overwritten and destroyed by ongoing plasticity related to the storage of new memories.

Nrf2 activation by sulforaphane restores the age-related decrease of T(H)1 immunity: role of dendritic cells., BACKGROUND: The decrease in cellular immunity with aging is of considerable public health importance. Recent studies suggest that the redox equilibrium of dendritic cells (DCs) is a key factor in maintaining protective cellular immunity and that a disturbance of this homeostatic mechanism could contribute to immune senescence. OBJECTIVES: We sought (1) to elucidate the role of DC redox equilibrium in the decrease of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) and T(H)1 immunity during aging and (2) to determine how restoration of glutathione (GSH) levels by the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense pathway affects this decrease. METHODS: We assessed the effect of Nrf2 deficiency and boosting of GSH levels by the Nrf2 agonist sulforaphane or the thiol precursor N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on the CHS response to contact antigens in old mice. We studied the effect of SFN and NAC on restoring T(H)1 immunity by treating DCs ex vivo before adoptive transfer and in vivo challenge. RESULTS: Aging was associated with a decreased CHS response that was accentuated by Nrf2 deficiency. Systemic SFN treatment reversed this decrease through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzyme expression and GSH synthesis. Adoptive transfer of DCs from old animals induced a weakened CHS response in recipient animals. Treatment of DCs from old animals with SFN or NAC ex vivo restored the in vivo challenge response. CONCLUSION: SFN and NAC upregulate T(H)1 immunity in aging through a restoration of redox equilibrium."

Dynamics of Mammalian Chromosome Evolution Inferred from Multispecies Comparative Maps, The genome organizations of eight phylogenetically distinct species from five mammalian orders were compared in order to address fundamental questions relating to mammalian chromosomal evolution. Rates of chromosome evolution within mammalian orders were found to increase since the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Nearly 20% of chromosome breakpoint regions were reused during mammalian evolution; these reuse sites are also enriched for centromeres. Analysis of gene content in and around evolutionary breakpoint regions revealed increased gene density relative to the genome-wide average. We found that segmental duplications populate the majority of primate-specific breakpoints and often flank inverted chromosome segments

Decanalization and the origin of complex disease, Complex genetic disease is caused by the interaction between genetic and environmental variables and is the predominant cause of mortality globally. Recognition that susceptibility arises through the combination of multiple genetic pathways that influence liability factors in a nonlinear manner suggests that a process of 'decanalization' contributes to the epidemic nature of common genetic diseases. The rapid evolution of the human genome combined with marked environmental and cultural perturbation in the past two generations might lead to the uncovering of cryptic genetic variation that is a major source of disease susceptibility."

The case of the disappearing teaspoons: longitudinal cohort study of the displacement of teaspoons in an Australian research institute, Objectives To determine the overall rate of loss of workplace teaspoons and whether attrition and displacement are correlated with the relative value of the teaspoons or type of tearoom.  Design Longitudinal cohort study.  Setting Research institute employing about 140 people.  Subjects 70 discreetly numbered teaspoons placed in tearooms around the institute and observed weekly over five months.  Main outcome measures Incidence of teaspoon loss per 100 teaspoon years and teaspoon half life.  Results 56 (80%) of the 70 teaspoons disappeared during the study. The half life of the teaspoons was 81 days. The half life of teaspoons in communal tearooms (42 days) was significantly shorter than for those in rooms associated with particular research groups (77 days). The rate of loss was not influenced by the teaspoons' value. The incidence of teaspoon loss over the period of observation was 360.62 per 100 teaspoon years. At this rate

A bayesian statistical algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction., A Bayesian approach for predicting RNA secondary structure that addresses the following three open issues is described: (1) the need for a representation of the full ensemble of probable structures; (2) the need to specify a fixed set of energy parameters; (3) the desire to make statistical inferences on all variables in the problem. It has recently been shown that Bayesian inference can be employed to relax or eliminate the need to specify the parameters of bioinformatics recursive algorithms and to give a statistical representation of the full ensemble of probable solutions with the incorporation of uncertainty in parameter values. In this paper

Information theory and neural coding., Information theory quantifies how much information a neural response carries about the stimulus. This can be compared to the information transferred in particular models of the stimulus鈭抮esponse function and to maximum possible information transfer. Such comparisons are crucial because they validate assumptions present in any neurophysiological analysis. Here we review information-theory basics before demonstrating its use in neural coding. We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus鈭抮esponse models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision

Environmental diversity: on the best-possible use of surrogate data for assessing the relative biodiversity of sets of areas, The conservation goal of representation of biodiversity (in the broad sense of all species) in protected areas requires best- possible use of available surrogate information. One standard approach is based on 'indicator' groups of taxa. A minimum set of areas having at least one representation of each indicator species is taken to be representative of other organisms. This same minimum-set approach is adapted to other 'attributes' of biodiversity
The Economic Implications of Learning by Doing, Demonstrates that technical change is attributable to experience. The cumulative production of capital goods is used as the index of experience.

Probabilistic Counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications, This paper introduces a class of probabilistic counting lgorithms with which one can  estimate the number of distinct elements in a large collection of data (typically a large file  stored on disk) in a single pass using only a small additional storage (typically less than a  hundred binary words) and only a few operations per element scanned. The algorithms are  based on statistical observations made on bits of hashed values of records. They are by con-  struction totally insensitive to the replicafive structure of elements in the file; they can be used  in the context of distributed systems without any degradation of performances and prove  especially useful in the context of data bases query optimisation. ; 1985 Academic Press

Eigengene networks for studying the relationships between co-expression modules, BACKGROUND:There is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules.RESULTS:We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First

That coupling can be generalized in order to include the effect of additional randomness and nonlinearities which can be present in real-world networks. The model generates weighted graphs exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world systems. In particular

The Development of Scientific Reasoning Skills, The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to the growing body of research on the development of scientific reasoning skills. The focus is on the reasoning and problem-solving strategies involved in experimentation and evidence evaluation. Research on strategy use in science has undergone considerable development in the last decade. Early research focused on knowledge-lean tasks or on tasks in which subjects were instructed to disregard prior knowledge. Klahr and Dunbar (1988) developed an integrated model of scientific discovery that has served as a framework to study the interaction of conceptual knowledge and the set of cognitive skills used in scientific reasoning. Researchers now take a more integrated approach

Transcription Factors Bind Thousands of Active and Inactive Regions in the Drosophila Blastoderm, Identifying the genomic regions bound by sequence-specific regulatory factors is central both to deciphering the complex DNA cis -regulatory code that controls transcription in metazoans and to determining the range of genes that shape animal morphogenesis. We used whole-genome tiling arrays to map sequences bound in Drosophila melanogaster embryos by the six maternal and gap transcription factors that initiate anterior芒鈧€減osterior patterning. We find that these sequence-specific DNA binding proteins bind with quantitatively different specificities to highly overlapping sets of several thousand genomic regions in blastoderm embryos. Specific high- and moderate-affinity in vitro recognition sequences for each factor are enriched in bound regions. This enrichment

Web 2.0 and social software: the medical student way of e-learning., Background: A wide range of social software has become readily available to young people. There is increasing interest in the exciting possibilities of using social software for undergraduate medical education. Aims: To identify the nature and extent of the use of social software by first year medical students. Method: A structured self-administered questionnaire survey of 212 students. Results: Over 90 percent used instant messaging and social networking sites were highly used (70 percent). There was no significant difference between males and females. Blogs were read by about a fifth of students and a small number (8%) wrote their own blogs. A fifth of males stated that they were users of media sharing and contributed to wikis. Social bookmarking was rarely used by either sex. Conclusion: Medical educators need to recognise the potential of social software in undergraduate medical education but it is essential that students maintain the informality and privacy of these sites. The challenge for all medical educators is how to integrate social software into current curricula and institutional Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs)."

A general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequence of two proteins., A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons

Experimental identification of novel miRNAs is difficult because they are often transcribed under specific conditions and cell types. Several computational methods were developed to detect new miRNAs starting from known ones or from deep sequencing data
A Learning Approach to Shallow Parsing, A SNoW based learning approach to shallow parsing tasks is presented and studied experimentally.  The shallow parsing method suggested learns to identify syntactic patterns by  combining simple predictors to produce a coherent inference. Learned predictors are cascaded  and their outcome is used as an input to an inference algorithm that produces the nal phrases.  We discuss the requirements from a learning system for this approach to be applicable and  present a system based on the SNoW learning architecture that satises these conditions.  Two instantiations of this approach are studied and experimental results for Noun-Phrases  (NP) and Subject-Verb (SV) phrases that compare favorably with the best published results are  presented. In doing that

Volunteering as Red Queen Mechanism for Cooperation in Public Goods Games, The evolution of cooperation among nonrelated individuals is one of the fundamental problems in biology and social sciences. Reciprocal altruism fails to provide a solution if interactions are not repeated often enough or groups are too large.

Optional participation can foil exploiters and overcome the social dilemma. In voluntary public goods interactions
What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic, Floating-point arithmetic is considered an esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising because 铿俹ating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems. Almost every language has a 铿俹ating-point datatype; computers from PC鈥檚 to supercomputers have 铿俹ating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile 铿俹ating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to 铿俹ating-point exceptions such as over铿俹w. This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of 铿俹ating- point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on 铿俹ating-point representation and rounding error

Conceptual Framework for Tasks in Information Studies, Today information-intensive work tasks in professional settings involve highly dynamic information utilization in which information seeking and searching tasks are taking a more central role. This article considers the concept of task in the context of information studies in order to provide a definitional clarity for task-based information seeking and retrieval studies. We identify (1) the central task levels as well as (2) the kinds of dimensions connected to the levels from the perspective of information studies. The analysis is aimed to serve as a conceptual starting point for empirical studies in the research area. The focus is on some central aspects of tasks that are recognized within information studies as well as related research areas (e.g.

Modeling of protein interaction networks, We introduce a graph generating model aimed at representing the evolution of protein interaction networks. The model is based on the hypotesis of evolution by duplications and divergence of the genes which produce proteins. The obtained graphs shows multifractal properties recovering the absence of a characteristic connectivity as found in real data of protein interaction networks. The error tolerance of the model to random or targeted damage is in very good agreement with the behavior obtained in real protein networks analysis. The proposed model is a first step in the identification of the evolutionary dynamics leading to the development of protein functions and interactions."

How different are structurally flexible and rigid binding sites? Sequence and structural features discriminating proteins that do and do not undergo conformational change upon ligand binding., Proteins are dynamic molecules and often undergo conformational change upon ligand binding. It is widely accepted that flexible loop regions have a critical functional role in enzymes. Lack of consideration of binding site flexibility has led to failures in predicting protein functions and in successfully docking ligands with protein receptors. Here we address the question: which sequence and structural features distinguish the structurally flexible and rigid binding sites? We analyze high-resolution crystal structures of ligand bound (holo) and free (apo) forms of 41 proteins where no conformational change takes place upon ligand binding

DNA Transposons and the Evolution of Eukaryotic Genomes, Transposable elements are mobile genetic units that exhibit broad diversity in their structure and transposition mechanisms. Transposable elements occupy a large fraction of many eukaryotic genomes and their movement and accumulation represent a major force shaping the genes and genomes of almost all organisms. This review focuses on DNA-mediated or class 2 transposons and emphasizes how this class of elements is distinguished from other types of mobile elements in terms of their structure
Extending UML to Support Ontology Engineering for the Semantic Web, 5 GRC International Abstract. There is rapidly growing momentum for web enabled agents that reason about and dynamically integrate the appropriate knowledge and services at run-time. The World Wide Web Consortium and the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) program have been actively involved in furthering this trend. The dynamic integration of knowledge and services depends on the existence of explicit declarative semantic models (ontologies). DAML is an emerging language for specifying machine-readable ontologies on the web. DAML was designed to support tractable reasoning. We have been developing tools for developing ontologies in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and generating DAML. This allows the many mature UML tools

Modelling Vague Places with Knowledge from the Web, Place names are often used to describe and to enquire about geographical information. It is common for users to employ vernacular names that have vague spatial extent and which do not correspond to the official and administrative place name terminology recorded within typical gazetteers. There is a need therefore to enrich gazetteers with knowledge of such vague places and hence improve the quality of place name-based information retrieval. Here we describe a method for modelling vague places using knowledge harvested from Web pages. It is found that vague place names are frequently accompanied in text by the names of more precise co-located places that lie within the extent of the target vague place. Density surface modelling of the frequency of co-occurrence of such names provides an effective method of representing the inherent uncertainty of the extent of the vague place while also enabling approximate crisp boundaries to be derived from contours if required. The method is evaluated using both precise and vague places. The use of the resulting approximate boundaries is demonstrated using an experimental geographical search engine."

Extensive low-affinity transcriptional interactions in the yeast genome., Major experimental and computational efforts are targeted at the characterization of transcriptional networks on a genomic scale. The ultimate goal of many of these studies is to construct networks associating transcription factors with genes via well-defined binding sites. Weaker regulatory interactions other than those occurring at high-affinity binding sites are largely ignored and are not well understood. Here I show that low-affinity interactions are abundant in vivo and quantifiable from current high-throughput ChIP experiments. I develop algorithms that predict DNA-binding energies from sequences and ChIP data across a wide dynamic range of affinities and use them to reveal widespread functionality of low-affinity transcription factor binding. Evolutionary analysis suggests that binding energies of many transcription factors are conserved even in promoters lacking classical binding sites. Gene expression analysis shows that such promoters can generate significant expression. I estimate that while only a small percentage of the genome is strongly regulated by a typical transcription factor

The two major analytical challenges are the segmentation of the hybridization signal along genomic coordinates to accurately determine transcript boundaries and the adjustment of the sequence-dependent response of the oligonucleotide probes to achieve quantitative comparability of the signal between different probes.Results: We describe a dynamic programming algorithm for finding a globally optimal fit of a piecewise constant expression profile along genomic coordinates. We developed a probe-specific background correction and scaling method that employs empirical probe response parameters determined from reference hybridizations with no need for paired mismatch probes. This combined analysis approach allows the accurate determination of dynamical changes in transcription architectures from hybridization data and will help to study the biological significance of complex transcriptional phenomena in eukaryotic genomes.Availability: R package tilingArray at http://www.bioconductor.org.Contact:huber@ebi.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity: From Synapse to Perception, Information in the nervous system may be carried by both the rate and timing of neuronal spikes. Recent findings of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have fueled the interest in the potential roles of spike timing in processing and storage of information in neural circuits. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems has been shown to depend on the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking. Spike timing-dependent modification of neuronal excitability and dendritic integration was also observed. Such STDP at the synaptic and cellular level is likely to play important roles in activity-induced functional changes in neuronal receptive fields and human perception. 10.1152/physrev.00030.2005"

Lifespan Regulation by Evolutionarily Conserved Genes Essential for Viability.,  Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that control aging are predicted to have pre-reproductive functions in order to be subject to natural selection. Genes that are essential for growth and development are highly conserved in evolution but their role in longevity has not previously been assessed. We screened 2700 genes essential for Caenorhabditis elegans development and identified 64 genes that extend lifespan when inactivated post-developmentally. These candidate lifespan regulators are highly conserved from yeast to humans. Classification of the candidate lifespan regulators into functional groups identified the expected insulin and metabolic pathways but also revealed enrichment for translation-

Social navigation in web lectures, Web lectures are a form of educational content that differs from classic hypertext in a number of ways. Web lectures are easier to produce and therefore large amounts of material become accumulated in a short time. The recordings are significantly less structured than traditional web based learning content and they are time based media. Both the lack of structure and their time based nature pose difficulties for navigation in web lectures. The approach presented in this paper applies the basic concept of social navigation to facilitate navigation in web lectures. Social navigation support has been successfully employed for hypertext and picture augmented hypertext in the education domain. This paper describes how social navigation can be implemented for web lectures and how it can be used to augment existent navigation features."

An affine invariant interest point detector,   This paper presents a novel approach for detecting affine invariant interest points. Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas: 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. Amulti-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location

Spatiotemporal energy models for the perception of motion, A motion sequence may be represented as a single pattern in x-y-t space; a velocity of motion corresponds to a three-dimensional orientation in this space. Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics
Dynamic spike threshold reveals a mechanism for synaptic coincidence detection in cortical neurons in vivo, Cortical neurons are sensitive to the timing of their synaptic inputs. They can synchronize their firing on a millisecond time scale and follow rapid stimulus fluctuations with high temporal precision. These findings suggest that cortical neurons have an enhanced sensitivity to synchronous synaptic inputs that lead to rapid rates of depolarization. The voltage-gated currents underlying action potential generation may provide one mechanism to amplify rapid depolarizations. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the relations between membrane potential fluctuations and spike threshold in cat visual cortical neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo. We find that visual stimuli evoke broad variations in spike threshold that are caused in large part by an inverse relation between spike threshold and the rate of membrane depolarization preceding a spike. We also find that spike threshold is inversely related to the rate of rise of the action potential upstroke

Simultaneous determination of protein structure and dynamics, We present a protocol for the experimental determination of ensembles of protein conformations that represent simultaneously the native structure and its associated dynamics. The procedure combines the strengths of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy鈥攆or obtaining experimental information at the atomic level about the structural and dynamical features of proteins鈥攚ith the ability of molecular dynamics simulations to explore a wide range of protein conformations. We illustrate the method for human ubiquitin in solution and find that there is considerable conformational heterogeneity throughout the protein structure. The interior atoms of the protein are tightly packed in each individual conformation that contributes to the ensemble but their overall behaviour can be described as having a significant degree of liquid-like character. The protocol is completely general and should lead to significant advances in our ability to understand and utilize the structures of native proteins."

Signal processing methods for the automatic transcription of music, Signal processing methods for the automatic transcription of music are developed in this thesis. Music transcription is here understood as the process of analyzing a music signal so as to write down the parameters of the sounds that occur in it. The applied notation can be the traditional musical notation or any symbolic representation which gives sufficient information for performing the piece using the available musical instruments. Recovering the musical notation automatically for a given acoustic signal allows musicians to reproduce and modify the original performance. Another principal application is structured audio coding: a MIDI-like representation is extremely compact yet retains the identifiability and characteristics of a piece of music to an important degree. The scope of this thesis is in the automatic transcription of the harmonic and melodic parts of real-world music signals. Detecting or labeling the sounds of percussive instruments (drums) is not attempted
Nucleosomal Fluctuations Govern the Transcription Dynamics of RNA Polymerase II, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) must overcome the barriers imposed by nucleosomes during transcription elongation.

Large-scale model of mammalian thalamocortical systems, The understanding of the structural and dynamic complexity of mammalian brains is greatly facilitated by computer simulations. We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics

A Probabilistic Approach to WLAN User Location Estimation, We estimate the location of a WLAN user based on radio signal strength measurements performed by the user聮s mobile terminal. In our approach the physical properties of the signal propagation are not taken into account directly. Instead the location estimation is regarded as a machine learning problem in which the task is to model how the signal strengths are distributed in different geographical areas based on a sample of measurements collected at several known locations. We present a probabilistic framework for solving the location estimation problem. In the empirical part of the paper we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by reporting results of field tests in which a probabilistic location estimation method is validated in a real-world indoor environment."

Comparative metagenomics of microbial communities., The species complexity of microbial communities and challenges in culturing representative isolates make it difficult to obtain assembled genomes. Here we characterize and compare the metabolic capabilities of terrestrial and marine microbial communities using largely unassembled sequence data obtained by shotgun sequencing DNA isolated from the various environments. Quantitative gene content analysis reveals habitat-specific fingerprints that reflect known characteristics of the sampled environments. The identification of environment-specific genes through a gene-centric comparative analysis presents new opportunities for interpreting and diagnosing environments. 10.1126/science.1107851"

Ontology-based integration of information - a survey of existing approaches, We review the use on ontologies for the integration  of heterogeneous information sources. Based  on an in-depth evaluation of existing approaches to  this problem we discuss how ontologies are used to  support the integration task. We evaluate and compare  the languages used to represent the ontologies  and the use of mappings between ontologies as well  as to connect ontologies with information sources.  We also ask for ontology engineering methods and  tools used to develop ontologies for information integration.  Based on the results of our analysis we  summarize the state of the art in ontology-based information  integration and name areas of further research  activities.  1 Motivation  The so-called information society demands for complete access to available information

Automated manipulation of systems biology models using libSBML within Taverna workflows., Many data manipulation processes involve the use of programming libraries. These processes may beneficially be automated due to their repeated use. A convenient type of automation is in the form of workflows that also allow such processes to be shared amongst the community. The Taverna workflow system has been extended to enable it to use and invoke Java classes and methods as tasks within Taverna workflows. These classes and methods are selected for use during workflow construction by a Java Doclet application called the API Consumer. This selection is stored as an XML file which enables Taverna to present the subset of the API for use in the composition of workflows. The ability of Taverna to invoke Java classes and methods is demonstrated by a workflow in which we use libSBML to map gene expression data onto a metabolic pathway represented as a SBML model. AVAILABILITY: Taverna and the API Consumer application can be freely downloaded from http://taverna.sourceforge.net"

Phylogenetic Shadowing of Primate Sequences to Find Functional Regions of the Human Genome, Nonhuman primates represent the most relevant model organisms to understand the biology of Homo sapiens. The recent divergence and associated overall sequence conservation between individual members of this taxon have nonetheless largely precluded the use of primates in comparative sequence studies. We used sequence comparisons of an extensive set of Old World and New World monkeys and hominoids to identify functional regions in the human genome. Analysis of these data enabled the discovery of primate-specific gene regulatory elements and the demarcation of the exons of multiple genes. Much of the information content of the comprehensive primate sequence comparisons could be captured with a small subset of phylogenetically close primates. These results demonstrate the utility of intraprimate sequence comparisons to discover common mammalian as well as primate-specific functional elements in the human genome

Improved side-chain modeling for protein-protein docking., Success in high-resolution protein-protein docking requires accurate modeling of side-chain conformations at the interface. Most current methods either leave side chains fixed in the conformations observed in the unbound protein structures or allow the side chains to sample a set of discrete rotamer conformations. Here we describe a rapid and efficient method for sampling off-rotamer side-chain conformations by torsion space minimization during protein-protein docking starting from discrete rotamer libraries supplemented with side-chain conformations taken from the unbound structures
Remarkably ancient balanced polymorphisms in a multi-locus gene network, Local adaptations within species are often governed by several interacting genes scattered throughout the genome.

Human Genome Ultraconserved Elements Are Ultraselected, Ultraconserved elements in the human genome are defined as stretches of at least 200 base pairs of DNA that match identically with corresponding regions in the mouse and rat genomes. Most ultraconserved elements are noncoding and have been evolutionarily conserved since mammal and bird ancestors diverged over 300 million years ago. The reason for this extreme conservation remains a mystery. It has been speculated that they are mutational cold spots or regions where every site is under weak but still detectable negative selection. However
Ultraconserved Regions Encoding ncRNAs Are Altered in Human Leukemias and Carcinomas., Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts are thought to be involved in human tumorigenesis. We report that a large fraction of genomic ultraconserved regions (UCRs) encode a particular set of ncRNAs whose expression is altered in human cancers. Genome-wide profiling revealed that UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemias and carcinomas. UCRs are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers. We identified certain UCRs whose expression may be regulated by microRNAs abnormally expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia

The neural basis of altruistic punishment, Many people voluntarily incur costs to punish violations of social norms. Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used H2 15O positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff

Small RNAs just got bigger: Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in mammalian testes, 10.1101/gad.1456106 Small RNAs constitute a large family of regulatory molecules with diverse functions in eukaryotes. Hallmarks of small RNAs are their dependence on double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA)-specific RNase III-type enzymes for biogenesis and their association with Argonaute family proteins for the silencing process. At least two classes of small RNAs have previously been described: microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from hairpin-shaped precursors and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated from long dsRNAs. Recent articles reported a novel class of small RNAs that are expressed specifically and abundantly in the spermatogenic cells of mice. These RNAs are bigger (26鈥?1 nucleotides [nt]) than most previously described small RNAs (21鈥?3 nt) and are associated with Piwi-subclade members of the Argonaute protein family. Although the biogenesis and function of these RNAs are yet to be determined

Mutation-Selection Models of Codon Substitution and Their Use to Estimate Selective Strengths on Codon Usage, Current models of codon substitution are formulated at the levels of nucleotide substitution and do not explicitly consider the separate effects of mutation and selection. They are thus incapable of inferring whether mutation or selection is responsible for evolution at silent sites. Here we implement a few population genetics models of codon substitution that explicitly consider mutation bias and natural selection at the DNA level. Selection on codon usage is modeled by introducing codon-fitness parameters

This formal ontology is based on some metaproperties built around the fundamental philosophical notions of identity

Targeted screening of cis-regulatory variation in human haplotypes., Regulatory cis-acting variants account for a large proportion of gene expression variability in populations. Cis-acting differences can be specifically measured by comparing relative levels of allelic transcripts within a sample. Allelic expression (AE) mapping for cis-regulatory variant discovery has been hindered by the requirements of having informative or heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes in order to assign the allelic origin of each transcript. In this study we have developed an approach to systematically screen for heritable cis-variants in common human haplotypes across >1

Automatic Extraction of Useful Facet Hierarchies from Text Databases, Databases of text and text-annotated data constitute a significant fraction of the information available in electronic form. Searching and browsing are the typical ways that users locate items of interest in such databases. Faceted interfaces represent a new powerful paradigm that proved to be a successful complement to searching. Thus far the identification of the facets was either a manual procedure or relied on apriori knowledge of the facets that can potentially appear in the underlying collection. In this paper we present an unsupervised technique for automatic extraction of facets useful for browsing text databases. In particular we observe through a pilot study that facet terms rarely appear in text documents showing that we need external resources to identify useful facet terms. For this we first identify important phrases in each document. Then we expand each phrase with ""context"" phrases using external resources such as WordNet and Wikipedia causing facet terms to appear in the expanded database. Finally we compare the term distributions in the original database and the expanded database to identify the terms that can be used to construct browsing facets. Our extensive user studies using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service show that our techniques produce facets with high precision and recall that are superior to existing approaches and help users locate interesting items faster."

The use of gene ontology evidence codes in preventing classifier assessment bias, Motivation: The biological community's reliance on computational annotations of protein function makes correct assessment of function prediction methods an issue of great importance. The fact that a large fraction of the annotations in current biological databases are based on computational methods can lead to bias in estimating the accuracy of function prediction methods. This can happen since predicting an annotation that was derived computationally in the first place is likely easier than predicting annotations that were derived experimentally

Numerical Cognition Without Words: Evidence from Amazonia, Members of the Piraha tribe use a ""one-two-many"" system of counting. I ask whether speakers of this innumerate language can appreciate larger numerosities without the benefit of words to encode them.

Results of numerical tasks with varying cognitive demands show that numerical cognition is clearly affected by the lack of a counting system in the language. Performance with quantities greater than three was remarkably poor
Thermodynamic calculations in biological systems, The ability to compute intra- and inter-molecular interactions provides the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of previously intractable problems in biochemistry and biophysics.

The three examples are the following: (1) Entropic contribution to rate acceleration that results from conformational constraints imposed on the reactants; (2) Mechanism of force unfolding of a small protein molecule by the application of a force that separates its N- and C-terminals; and (3) Loss of translational entropy experienced by small molecules when they bind to proteins."

A mutation accumulation assay reveals a broad capacity for rapid evolution of gene expression, Mutation is the ultimate source of biological diversity because it generates the variation that fuels evolution(1). Gene expression is the first step by which an organism translates genetic information into developmental change. Here we estimate the rate at which mutation produces new variation in gene expression by measuring transcript abundances across the genome during the onset of metamorphosis in 12 initially identical Drosophila melanogaster lines that independently accumulated mutations for 200 generations(2). We find statistically significant mutational variation for 39% of the genome and a wide range of variability across corresponding genes. As genes are upregulated in development their variability decreases

Detecting intergene correlation changes in microarray analysis: a new approach to gene selection., BACKGROUND: Microarray technology is commonly used as a simple screening tool with a focus on selecting genes that exhibit extremely large differential expressions between different phenotypes. It lacks the ability to select genes that change their relationships with other genes in different biological conditions (differentially correlated genes). We intend to enrich the above procedure by proposing a nonparametric selection procedure that selects differentially correlated genes. RESULTS: Using both simulations and resampling techniques

FMRI potentially can reveal additional information about the degree to which components of large-scale neural systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks. In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally connected circuits

Examples  are given specifically for modifying Gaussian Radial Basis Function kernels. Simulation results for  both artificial and real data show remarkable improvement of generalization errors

A Lagrangian particle level set method, We present a novel particle level set method for capturing interfaces. The level set equation is solved in a Lagrangian frame using particles that carry the level set information. A key aspect of the method involves a consistent remeshing procedure for the regularization of the particle locations when the particle map gets distorted by the advection field. The Lagrangian description of the level set method is inherently adaptive and exact in the case of solid body motions. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated in several benchmark problems in two and three dimensions involving pure advection and curvature induced motion of the interface. The simplicity of the particle description is shown to be well suited for real time simulations of surfaces involving cutting and reconnection as in virtual surgery environments."

A barrier nucleosome model for statistical positioning of nucleosomes throughout the yeast genome., Most nucleosomes are well-organized at the 5' ends of S. cerevisiae genes where ""-1"" and ""+1"" nucleosomes bracket a nucleosome-free promoter region (NFR). How nucleosomal organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome organization by sequencing DNA from more than one million immunopurified S. cerevisiae nucleosomes (displayed at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of statistical packing principles. The genomic sequence specifies the location of the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed
CisModule: De novo discovery of cis-regulatory modules by hierarchical mixture modeling, 10.1073/pnas.0402858101 The regulatory information for a eukaryotic gene is encoded in cis-regulatory modules.

The model allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and spot-asset returns. I introduce stochastic interest rates and show how to apply the model to bond options and foreign currency options. Simulations show that correlation between volatility and the spot asset's price is important for explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black-Scholes (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions and can be applied to other problems."

A Taxonomy of Global Optimization Methods Based on Response Surfaces, Abstract. This paper presents a taxonomy of existing approaches for using response surfaces for global optimization. Each method is illustrated with a simple numerical example that brings out its advantages and disadvantages. The central theme is that methods that seem quite reasonable often have non-obvious failure modes. Understanding these failure modes is essential for the development of practical algorithms that fulfill the intuitive promise of the response surface approach. Key words: global optimization

Quantum State Transfer and Entanglement Distribution among Distant Nodes in a Quantum Network, We propose a scheme to utilize photons for ideal quantum transmission between atoms located at spatially separated nodes of a quantum network. The transmission protocol employs special laser pulses that excite an atom inside an optical cavity at the sending node so that its state is mapped into a time-symmetric photon wave packet that will enter a cavity at the receiving node and be absorbed by an atom there with unit probability. Implementation of our scheme would enable reliable transfer or sharing of entanglement among spatially distant atoms."
Large datasets at a glance: combining textures and colors in scientific visualization, We present a new method for using texture and color to visualize multivariate data elements arranged on an underlying height field. We combine simple texture patterns with perceptually uniform colors to increase the number of attribute values we can display simultaneously. Our technique builds multicolored perceptual texture elements (or pexels) to represent each data element. Attribute values encoded in an element are used to vary the appearance of its pexel. Texture and color patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by varying three separate texture dimensions: height

The first measures patterns of aggregation among records within each species' range to identify areas within the core (i.e.

Here we report that several basic auditory nerve fiber tuning properties can be accounted for by adapting a population of filter shapes to encode natural sounds efficiently. The form of the code depends on sound class

Quantum probabilities as Bayesian probabilities, In the Bayesian approach to probability theory; probability quantifies a degree of belief for a single trial; without any  a priori  connection to limiting frequencies. In this paper; we show that; despite being prescribed by a fundamental law; probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood within the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical and quantum probabilities lies not in their definition; but in the nature of the information they encode. In the classical world;  maximal  information about a physical system is  complete  in the sense of providing definite answers for all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world;  maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed . Using this distinction; we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule; that maximal information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment; and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally; we give a Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography."

We test our similarity measure on computer-generated networks for which the expected results are known

Maximum likelihood estimation of a migration matrix and effective population sizes in n subpopulations by using a coalescent approach, A maximum likelihood estimator based on the coalescent for unequal migration rates and different subpopulation sizes is developed. The method uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to investigate possible genealogies with branch lengths and with migration events. Properties of the new method are shown by using simulated data from a four-population n-island model and a source-sink population model. Our estimation method as coded in migrate is tested against genetree; both programs deliver a very similar likelihood surface. The algorithm converges to the estimates fairly quickly

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, _Design Patterns_ is based on the idea that there are only so many design problems in computer programming. This book identifies some common program- design problems--such as adapting the interface of one object to that of another object or notifying an object of a change in another object's state-- and explains the best ways (not always the obvious ways) that the authors know to solve them. The idea is that you can use the authors' sophisticated design ideas to solve problems that you often waste time solving over and over again in your own programming.  The authors have come up with some ingenious ways to solve some common vexations among object-oriented programmers. Want to build a page-layout program that embeds inline images among characters of various sizes? How about building a program that converts files of one format to another? Chances are

RNA sequence analysis using covariance models., We describe a general approach to several RNA sequence analysis problems using probabilistic models that flexibly describe the secondary structure and primary sequence consensus of an RNA sequence family. We call these models covariance models'. A covariance model of tRNA sequences is an extremely sensitive and discriminative tool for searching for additional tRNAs and tRNA-related sequences in sequence databases. A model can be built automatically from an existing sequence alignment. We also describe an algorithm for learning a model and hence a consensus secondary structure from initially unaligned example sequences and no prior structural information. Models trained on unaligned tRNA examples correctly predict tRNA scondary structure and produce high-quality multiple alignments. The approach may be applied to any family of small RNA sequences. 10.1093/nar/22.11.2079"

Growing and navigating the small world Web by local content., Can we model the scale-free distribution of Web hypertext degree under realistic assumptions about the behavior of page authors? Can a Web crawler efficiently locate an unknown relevant page? These questions are receiving much attention due to their potential impact for understanding the structure of the Web and for building better search engines. Here I investigate the connection between the linkage and content topology of Web pages. The relationship between a text-induced distance metric and a link-based neighborhood probability distribution displays a phase transition between a region where linkage is not determined by content and one where linkage decays according to a power law. This relationship is used to propose a Web growth model that is shown to accurately predict the distribution of Web page degree

A brief history of stigmergy, doi: 10.1162/106454699568700 Stigmergy is a class of mechanisms that mediate animal-animal interactions. Its introduction in 1959 by Pierre-Paul Grass茅 made it possible to explain what had been until then considered paradoxical observations: In an insect society individuals work as if they were alone while their collective activities appear to be coordinated. In this article we describe the history of stigmergy in the context of social insects and discuss the general properties of two distinct stigmergic mechanisms: quantitative stigmergy and qualitative stigmergy."

Learning relational probability trees, Classification trees are widely used in the machine learning and data mining communities for modeling propositional data. Recent work has extended this basic paradigm to probability estimation trees. Traditional tree learning algorithms assume that instances in the training data are homogenous and independently distributed. Relational probability trees (RPTs) extend standard probability estimation trees to a relational setting in which data instances are heterogeneous and interdependent. Our algorithm for learning the structure and parameters of an RPT searches over a space of relational features that use aggregation functions (e.g. AVERAGE

Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma-dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries determined

Energetics of Protein Folding, The energetics of protein folding determine the 3D structure of a folded protein. Knowledge of the energetics is needed to predict the 3D structure from the amino acid sequence or to modify the structure by protein engi- neering. Recent developments are discussed: major factors are reviewed and auxiliary factors are discussed briefly. Major factors include the hydrophobic factor (burial of non-polar surface area) and van der Waals interactions together with peptide hydrogen bonds and peptide solvation. The long-standing model for the hydrophobic factor (free energy change proportional to buried non-polar surface area) is contrasted with the packing--desolvation model and the approximate nature of the proportion- ality between free energy and apolar surface area is discussed. Recent energetic studies of forming peptide hydrogen bonds (gas phase) are reviewed together with studies of peptide solvation in solution. Closer agreement is achieved between the 1995 values for protein unfolding enthalpies in vacuum given by Lazaridis-Archontis-Karplus and Makha- tadze-Privalov when the solvation enthalpy of the peptide group is taken from electrostatic calculations. Auxiliary factors in folding energetics include salt bridges and side-chain hydrogen bonds

Combining Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Co-training, We consider the problem of using a large unla beled sample to boost performance of a learn ing algorithm when only a small set of labeled examples is available In particular we con sider a setting in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages For example the descrip tion of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page and the words occurring in hyperlinks that point to that page  We assume that either view of the example would be sucient for learning if we had enough labeled data but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment a much smaller set of labeled ex amples Specically the presence of two dis tinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view and then each algo rithm s predictions on new unlabeled exam ples are used to enlarge the training set of the other Our goal in this paper is to provide a PACstyle analysis for this setting and more broadly a PACstyle framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and un labeled data We also provide empirical results on real webpage data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to signicant improvement of hypotheses in practice  As part of our analysis we provide new results on learning with lopsided misclassication noise which we believe may be of independent interest"

The dangers of replication and a solution, Update anywhere-anytime-anyway transactional replication has unstable behavior as the workload scales up: a ten-fold increase in nodes and traflc gives a thousand fold increase in deadlocks or reconciliations.

A new two-tier replication algorithm is proposed that allows mobile (disconnected) applications to propose tentative update trans-actions that are later applied to a master copy. Commutative update transactions avoid the instability of other replication schemes. 1."

Singularity Detection and Processing with Wavelets, The mathematical characterization of singularities with Lipschitz exponents is reviewed. Theorems that estimate local Lipschitz exponents of functions from the evolution across scales of their wavelet transform are reviewed. It is then proven that the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus detect the locations of irregular structures and provide numerical procedures to compute their Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations has a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations is measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that one- and two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed

Detecting microRNA activity from gene expression data, BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of protein coding genes. They control gene expression by either inhibiting translation or inducing mRNA degradation. A number of computational techniques have been developed to identify the targets of miRNAs. In this study we used predicted miRNA-gene interactions to analyse mRNA gene expression microarray data to predict miRNAs associated with particular diseases or conditions.RESULTS:Here we combine correspondence analysis

Topological structure and interaction strengths in model food webs, We report the results of carrying out a large number of simulations on a coevolutionary model of multispecies communities. A wide range of parameter values were investigated which allowed a rather complete picture of the change in behaviour of the model as these parameters were varied to be built up. Our main interest was in the nature of the community food webs constructed via the simulations. We identify the range of parameter values which give rise to realistic food webs and give arguments which allow some of the structure which is found to be understood in an intuitive way. Since the webs are evolved according to the rules of the model

I propose a sign test that compares the observed number of plus and minus alleles in the ""high line"" with that expected under neutrality

Dynamic Bayesian network and nonparametric regression for nonlinear modeling of gene networks from time series gene expression data., We propose a dynamic Bayesian network and nonparametric regression model for constructing a gene network from time series microarray gene expression data. The proposed method can overcome a shortcoming of the Bayesian network model in the sense of the construction of cyclic regulations. The proposed method can analyze the microarray data as a continuous data and can capture even nonlinear relations among genes. It can be expected that this model will give a deeper insight into complicated biological systems. We also derive a new criterion for evaluating an estimated network from Bayes approach. We conduct Monte Carlo experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also demonstrate the proposed method through the analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data."

Role of Delays in Shaping Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Neuronal Activity in Large Networks, We study the effect of delays on the dynamics of large networks of neurons. We show that delays give rise to a wealth of bifurcations and to a rich phase diagram; which includes oscillatory bumps; traveling waves; lurching waves; standing waves arising via a period-doubling bifurcation; aperiodic regimes; and regimes of multistability. We study the existence and the stability of the various dynamical patterns analytically and numerically in a simplified rate model as a function of the interaction parameters. The results derived in that framework allow us to understand the origin of the diversity of dynamical states observed in large networks of spiking neurons."

The striking signature of Bose condensation was the sudden appearance of a bimodal velocity distribution below the critical temperature of similar to 2 mu K The distribution consisted of an isotropic thermal distribution and an elliptical core attributed to the expansion of a dense condensate."
CoaSim: A Flexible Environment for Simulating Genetic Data under Coalescent Models, BACKGROUND: Coalescent simulations are playing a large role in interpreting large scale intra-specific sequence or polymorphism surveys and for planning and evaluating association studies. Coalescent simulations of data sets under different models can be compared to the actual data to test the importance of different evolutionary factors and thus get insight into these. RESULTS: We have created the CoaSim application as a flexible environment for Monte Carlo simulation of various types of genetic data under equilibrium and non-equilibrium coalescent processes for a variety of applications. Interaction with the tool is through the Guile version of the Scheme scripting language. Scheme scripts for many standard and advanced applications are provided and these can easily be modified by the user for a much wider range of applications. A graphical user interface with less functionality and flexibility is also included. It is primarily intended as an exploratory and educational tool CONCLUSION: CoaSim is a powerful tool because of its flexibility and ease of use. This is illustrated through very varied uses of the application

Functional connectivity in the motor cortex of resting human brain using echo-planar MRI., Abstract 10.1002/mrm.1910340409.abs An MRI time course of 512 echo-planar images (EPI) in resting human brain obtained every 250 ms reveals fluctuations in signal intensity in each pixel that have a physiologic origin. Regions of the sensorimotor cortex that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional MRI methodology (FMRI). Time courses of low frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (P < 10鈭?) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function. It is concluded that correlation of low frequency fluctuations

Verbal working memory and sentence comprehension., This target article discusses the verbal working memory system used in sentence comprehension. We review the concept of working memory as a short-duration system in which small amounts of information are simultaneously stored and manipulated in the service of accomplishing a task. We summarize the argument that syntactic processing in sentence comprehension requires such a storage and computational system. We then ask whether the working memory system used in syntactic processing is the same as that used in verbally mediated tasks that involve conscious controlled processing. Evidence is brought to bear from various sources: the relationship between individual differences in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with poor short-term memory

On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton, Starting from first principles and general assumptions Newton's law of gravitation is shown to arise naturally and unavoidably in a theory in which space is emergent through a holographic scenario. Gravity is explained as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies. A relativistic generalization of the presented arguments directly leads to the Einstein equations. When space is emergent even Newton's law of inertia needs to be explained. The equivalence principle leads us to conclude that it is actually this law of inertia whose origin is entropic."

Fast statistical alignment., We describe a new program for the alignment of multiple biological sequences that is both statistically motivated and fast enough for problem sizes that arise in practice. Our Fast Statistical Alignment program is based on pair hidden Markov models which approximate an insertion/deletion process on a tree and uses a sequence annealing algorithm to combine the posterior probabilities estimated from these models into a multiple alignment. FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment--previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches--yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover

A Role for Neural Integrators in Perceptual Decision Making, Decisions based on uncertain information may benefit from an accumulation of information over time. We asked whether such an accumulation process may underlie decisions about the direction of motion in a random dot kinetogram. To address this question we developed a computational model of the decision process using ensembles of neurons whose spiking activity mimics neurons recorded in the extrastriate visual cortex (area MT or V5) and a sensorimotor association area of the parietal lobe (area LIP). The model instantiates the hypothesis that neurons in sensorimotor association areas compute the time integral of sensory signals from the visual cortex

Identifying differentially expressed genes using false discovery rate controlling procedures., MOTIVATION: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. In this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to address the dependency problem

PISCES: recent improvements to a PDB sequence culling server, PISCES is a database server for producing lists of sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using a number of entry- and chain-specific criteria and mutual sequence identity. Our goal in culling the PDB is to provide the longest list possible of the highest resolution structures that fulfill the sequence identity and structural quality cut-offs. The new PISCES server uses a combination of PSI-BLAST and structure-based alignments to determine sequence identities.

Stochastic mRNA Synthesis in Mammalian Cells, Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell\&#39;s genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global
E-Commerce Recommendation Applications, Recommender systems are being used by an ever-increasing number of E-commerce sites to help consumers find products to purchase. What started as a novelty has turned into a serious business tool.

Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence

On the relations between the direction of two-dimensional arm movements and cell discharge in primate motor cortex., The activity of single cells in the motor cortex was recorded while monkeys made arm movements in eight directions (at 45 degrees intervals) in a two-dimensional apparatus. These movements started from the same point and were of the same amplitude. The activity of 606 cells related to proximal arm movements was examined in the task; 323 of the 606 cells were active in that task and were studied in detail. The frequency of discharge of 241 of the 323 cells (74.6%) varied in an orderly fashion with the direction of movement. Discharge was most intense with movements in a preferred direction and was reduced gradually when movements were made in directions farther and farther away from the preferred one. This resulted in a bell-shaped directional tuning curve. These relations were observed for cell discharge during the reaction time

Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: application to breast MR images, In this paper the authors present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast {MRI.} A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation {(FFD)} based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function

Gene networks inference using dynamic Bayesian networks., This article deals with the identification of gene regulatory networks from experimental data using a statistical machine learning approach. A stochastic model of gene interactions capable of handling missing variables is proposed. It can be described as a dynamic Bayesian network particularly well suited to tackle the stochastic nature of gene regulation and gene expression measurement. Parameters of the model are learned through a penalized likelihood maximization implemented through an extended version of EM algorithm. Our approach is tested against experimental data relative to the S.O.S. DNA Repair network of the Escherichia coli bacterium. It appears to be able to extract the main regulations between the genes involved in this network. An added missing variable is found to model the main protein of the network. Good prediction abilities on unlearned data are observed. These first results are very promising: they show the power of the learning algorithm and the ability of the model to capture gene interactions. Keywords: gene regulatory networks

A Detailed Investigation into the Effectiveness of Earcons, A detailed experimental evaluation of earcons was carried out to see whether they are an effective means of communicating information in sound. An initial experiment showed that earcons were better than unstructured bursts of sound and that musical timbres were more effective than simple tones. Musicians were shown to be no better than non-musicians when using musical timbres. A second experiment was then carried out which improved upon some of the weaknesses of the pitches and rhythms used in Experiment 1 to give a significant improvement in recognition. From the results some guidelines were drawn up for designers to use when creating earcons. These experiments have formally shown that earcons are an effective method for communicating complex information in sound."

The Energy Landscape of Social Balance, We model a close-knit community of friends and enemies as a fully connected network with positive and negative signs on its edges. Theories from social psychology suggest that certain sign patterns are more stable than others. This notion of social ""balance"" allows us to define an energy landscape for such networks. Its structure is complex: numerical experiments reveal a landscape dimpled with local minima of widely varying energy levels. We derive rigorous bounds on the energies of these local minima and prove that they have a modular structure that can be used to classify them."

The Many Meanings of Open Source, Many software development methodologies are called ""open source."" However simply stating that a project is open source doesn't precisely describe the approach used to support the project. A multidisciplinary viewpoint can help determine those characteristics that are common to open source projects and those that vary among projects. These characteristics form the basis for a taxonomy of open source projects that's useful for analyzing and setting up projects. They also provide a starting point for understanding what ""open source"" means."

Genome annotation errors in pathway databases due to semantic ambiguity in partial EC numbers, 10.1093/nar/gki711 We report on a new type of systematic annotation error in genome and pathway databases that results from the misinterpretation of partial Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers such as 芒聙聵1.1.1.-芒聙聶. This error results in the assignment of genes annotated with a partial EC number to many or all biochemical reactions that are annotated with the same partial EC number. That inference is faulty because of the ambiguous nature of partial EC numbers. We have observed this type of error in multiple databases

Biotic disturbance agents in the boreal forest: considerations for vegetation change models, Summary Disturbance regimes strongly determine vegetation patterns and succession in the boreal landscape. One of the current challenges for boreal vegetation modellers is to represent disturbance agents as dynamic factors that can respond to climate change. Outbreak species of insects and plant pathogens can cause marked changes in vegetation patterns and should be incorporated into vegetation change models. This introduction to the ecology of boreal biotic disturbance agents is designed as a brief overview for global change researchers and modellers. We discuss the importance of biotic disturbance agents in the boreal forest

A Simulated Study of Implicit Feedback Models, In this paper we report on a study of implicit feedback models for unobtrusively tracking the information needs of searchers. Such models use relevance information gathered from searcher interaction and can be a potential substitute for explicit relevance feedback. We introduce a variety of implicit feedback models designed to enhance an Information Retrieval (IR) system鈥檚 representation of searchers鈥?information needs. To benchmark their performance we use a simulation-centric evaluation methodology that measures how well each model learns relevance and improves search effectiveness. The results show that a heuristic-based binary voting model and one based on Jeffrey鈥檚 rule of conditioning [5] outperform the other models under investigation."

Two types of dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive and negative motivational signals., Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by reward or sensory stimuli predicting reward. These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face

Lost in translation: an assessment and perspective for computational microRNA target identification., MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenously expressed RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding directly to the messenger RNA of protein coding genes. They have been found to confer a novel layer of genetic regulation in a wide range of biological processes. Computational miRNA target prediction remains one of the key means used to decipher the role of miRNAs in development and disease. Here we introduce the basic idea behind the experimental identification of miRNA targets and present some of the most widely used computational miRNA target identification programs. The review includes an assessment of the prediction quality of these programs and their combinations. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
An introduction to quantum computing for non-physicists, Richard Feynman's observation that certain quantum mechanical effects cannot be simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in general could be done more efficiently if it used these quantum effects.

Results: We establish the mathematical foundations of our  distance and illustrate its use by constructing a phylogeny of the Eutherian orders using complete unaligned mitochondrial genomes. This phylogeny is consistent with the commonly accepted one for the Eutherians. A second

FaThumb: a facet-based interface for mobile search, In this paper we describe a novel approach for searching large data sets from a mobile phone. Existing interfaces for mobile search require keyword text entry and are not suited for browsing. Our alternative uses a hybrid model to de-emphasize tedious keyword entry in favor of iterative data filtering. We propose navigation and selection of hierarchical metadata (facet navigation)
Optimization of mutual information for multiresolution image registration, {Abstract{\\textemdash}We} propose a new method for the intermodal registration of images using a criterion known as mutual information. Our main contribution is an optimizer that we specifically designed for this criterion. We show that this new optimizer is well adapted to a multiresolution approach because it typically converges in fewer criterion evaluations than other optimizers. We have built a multiresolution image pyramid

Pathway analysis of gene signatures predicting metastasis of node-negative primary breast cancer., ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Published prognostic gene signatures in breast cancer have few genes in common. Here we provide a rationale for this observation by studying the prognostic power and the underlying biological pathways of different gene signatures. METHODS: Gene signatures to predict the development of metastases in estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors were identified using 500 re-sampled training sets and mapping to Gene Ontology Biological Process to identify over-represented pathways. The Global Test program confirmed that gene expression profilings in the common pathways were associated with the metastasis of the patients. RESULTS: The apoptotic pathway and cell division

Adaptive Evolution of Pelvic Reduction in Sticklebacks by Recurrent Deletion of a Pitx1 Enhancer, The molecular mechanisms underlying major phenotypic changes that have evolved repeatedly in nature are generally unknown. Pelvic loss in different natural populations of threespine stickleback fish has occurred through regulatory mutations deleting a tissue-specific enhancer of the Pituitary homeobox transcription factor 1 (Pitx1) gene. The high prevalence of deletion mutations at Pitx1 may be influenced by inherent structural features of the locus. Although Pitx1 null mutations are lethal in laboratory animals

A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification, The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples."

Excitatory and inhibitory interactions in localized populations of model neurons, Coupled nonlinear differential equations are derived for the dynamics of spatially localized populations containing both excitatory and inhibitory model neurons. Phase plane methods and numerical solutions are then used to investigate population responses to various types of stimuli. The results obtained show simple and multiple hysteresis phenomena and limit cycle activity. The latter is particularly interesting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic function of stimulus intensity. Finally
Discovery of Frequent Episodes in Event Sequences, Sequences of events describing the behavior and actions of users or systems can be collected in several domains.

Once such episodes are known
Predicting transcription factor affinities to DNA from a biophysical model, Motivation: Theoretical efforts to understand the regulation of gene expression are traditionally centered around the identification of transcription factor binding sites at specific DNA positions. More recently these efforts have been supplemented by experimental data for relative binding affinities of proteins to longer intergenic sequences. The question arises to what extent these two approaches converge. In this paper

Segmentation of 4D cardiac MR images using a probabilistic atlas and the EM algorithm, In this paper an automatic atlas-based segmentation algorithm for 4D cardiac MR images is proposed. The algorithm is based on the 4D extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm uses a 4D probabilistic cardiac atlas to estimate the initial model parameters and to integrate a priori information into the classification process. The probabilistic cardiac atlas has been constructed from the manual segmentations of 3D cardiac image sequences of 14 healthy volunteers. It provides space and time-varying probability maps for the left and right ventricles

TAPping into argumentation: Developments in the application of Toulmin's Argument Pattern for studying science discourse, Abstract 10.1002/sce.20012.abs This paper reports some methodological approaches to the analysis of argumentation discourse developed as part of the two-and-a-half year project titled 鈥淓nhancing the Quality of Argument in School Scienc'' supported by the Economic and Social Research Council in the United Kingdom. In this project researchers collaborated with middle-school science teachers to develop models of instructional activities in an effort to make argumentation a component of instruction. We begin the paper with a brief theoretical justification for why we consider argumentation to be of significance to science education. We then contextualize the use of Toulmin's Argument Pattern in the study of argumentation discourse and provide a justification for the methodological outcomes our approach generates. We illustrate how our work refines and develops research methodologies in argumentation analysis. In particular
Regression Quantiles, A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term regression quantiles. The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested
